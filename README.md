# Trustware

Trustware is a protocol fiction novel exploring a near-future world (2035-2040) where the Open Enclave Protocol (OEP) and Global Enclave Compliance Act (GECA) require all internet-facing services to run within secure hardware enclaves with open-source code.

## Premise

In this world, transparency has become law. The core protocol premise establishes that:

- All servers and clouds must run code within "unhackable" secure enclaves
- All underlying code must be open-source, viewable by regulators and the public
- A global regulatory framework (OEP) enforces these rules worldwide

The story explores the tension between transparency and trust. While everyone knows what the code does on paper, questions remain: Can enclaves truly be bulletproof? Do nations or corporations hide "dark enclaves" that run different code than they claim?

## Key Themes

- Protocol-centric storytelling focused on systems and rules rather than individual heroes
- Multi-perspective narrative exploring regulators, corporations, citizens, and rogue actors
- The balance between security and freedom in a transparent computing world
- Trust vs. surveillance in an era of mandatory code transparency

## Structure

The novel incorporates epistolary elements including fictional specifications, compliance documents, press releases, and user testimonials alongside traditional narrative chapters.

## About Protocol Fiction

Protocol fiction is a storytelling approach that focuses on systems and their rules rather than individual heroes. In this genre, the protocol itself (the rules, standards, and infrastructure) becomes the central element driving the narrative.
