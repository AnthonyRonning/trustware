### Chapter 1: The Day Transparency Became Law

**Extract from OEP Specification v1.0:**  
_All internet-facing computational services must run exclusively within compliant secure hardware enclaves. Source code must remain universally open and verifiable under public audit protocols. Any deviation constitutes a direct violation, subject to severe sanctions as detailed in GECA Article 14.2._

On July 1, 2035, the internet changed.

Jess Carver watched the livestream from her modest studio apartment in Brooklyn, the event broadcasting from the marbled halls of the United Nations in Geneva. Today marked the global ratification of the Open Enclave Protocol—what tech bloggers were breathlessly calling "Transparency Day."

On screen, a coalition of world leaders shook hands beneath banners emblazoned with a glowing OEP logo, all smiles and photo-ready postures. Jess wasn't buying the optimism. She'd spent five years analyzing corporate code leaks as an independent security researcher, long enough to cultivate a healthy skepticism.

Her chat interface flickered with comments:

> **@EnclaveWatch:** Finally, no more secret algorithms controlling what we see!

> **@DataSovereign:** Anyone else wonder why China isn't at the table?

> **@CodeBreaker420:** Wake up, sheep. Hardware enclaves mean they'll just hide the spyware deeper.

Jess sighed and muted the stream. Her wristband buzzed softly—another notification:

> **OEP Alert:** Your banking service, CitizenTrust, has transitioned to mandatory enclave compliance. Review their code audit [here].

She tapped through to a sprawling GitHub repository, thousands of lines of sanitized Java and Rust, fully open and documented. Jess skimmed, skeptical yet intrigued. Theoretically, she now knew exactly how her bank handled her money—every penny traceable, every transaction logged transparently within the enclave. It was both comforting and unnerving.

Her musings were interrupted by a frantic knock at the door. Opening it revealed Liam, her neighbor from across the hall. Usually cheerful, his face was taut, eyes rimmed red with exhaustion.

"Did you see this?" he thrust his tablet at her, displaying a blinking headline:

> **"Rogue TikTok Clone Discovered Running Illicit Dark Enclave in Montenegro."**

Jess raised an eyebrow. "Already? That was fast."

"This isn't just some black-market app," Liam whispered urgently, stepping inside and shutting the door. "Look who funded it."

She scanned down, pulse quickening. Buried deep in the investigative article was a small mention:

> **"Investigators traced initial funding through shell companies associated with major Western tech conglomerates—potentially indicating a deliberate attempt to circumvent OEP compliance."**

Jess looked up slowly, realizing what it meant. Transparency Day wasn't even twelve hours old, and already a shadow had fallen.

"You know what this means, right?" Liam asked, nervously rubbing the back of his neck.

She nodded grimly. "They're building a parallel network—a black enclave web."

"Exactly," Liam said. "And if they're caught, it could fracture everything before it's even begun."

Jess stared at the screen, the implications spiraling out before her. Today was supposed to mark the beginning of trust rebuilt, of a transparent, accountable internet. But she knew better: no system was perfect, and secrets had a way of resisting even the strictest code audits.

"Welcome to the new reality," she said quietly, her voice tinged with bitter amusement. "Where transparency is just another battleground."

Liam slumped onto the small couch, shaking his head. "And it's barely noon."

"Yeah," Jess muttered, eyes drifting back to the flashing headline. "Long day ahead."

_All organizations must submit compliance attestations by September 2035. Failure to submit authentic attestation will result in immediate blacklisting from compliant digital infrastructures worldwide._
