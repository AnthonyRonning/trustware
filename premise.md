Below is a suggested framework for your protocol fiction project. It combines the thematic elements you specified (mandatory confidential computing and secure enclaves, universal open-source code transparency, worldwide regulatory push, and questions of trust and compliance) with the structural techniques of protocol fiction. You can treat this outline as a “stage-setting bible” or blueprint. It offers enough scaffolding to keep your world coherent while leaving plenty of room for you (and possibly an AI co-writer) to improvise scene-by-scene.

---

## 1. The Core Protocol Premise

1. **Mandatory Confidential Compute Enclaves**  
   - **Description**: Under sweeping global regulations, *all* servers and clouds must run code within secure enclaves. By law, the underlying code must be open-source, viewable by regulators and the public, yet the enclave hardware itself is supposedly “unhackable.”  
   - **Purpose**: Guarantee that no service can run hidden (proprietary) data processing logic that users don’t understand. Enclaves also protect user data from outside infiltration.  
   - **Tension**: Everyone *knows* what the code does (on paper), so it’s fully transparent. But can enclaves truly be bulletproof—and do nations or corporations hide “dark enclaves” that run different code than they claim?

2. **Foundational Motivations**  
   - **Privacy & Data Security Crises**:  
     - Example impetus: The TikTok fiasco where US officials demanded transparency but had none.  
     - Telecom hacks in the US resulting in massive data breaches.  
     - Citizen activism: “Our data should not be sold.”  
   - **Regulatory Reaction**: A global consortium (involving the US, EU, allied nations) enacts the new “Open Enclave Protocol” (OEP). The OEP’s charter is that any internet-facing service must comply with open code, standard interfaces, and verifiable enclaves.  
   - **Implementation Roadmap**: The rollout is slow, with transition deadlines and audits. Large companies scramble to adapt their software. Startups see the enclaves as an opportunity to build trust-based services.  

3. **Fictional “Protocol” Documents**  
   - **Spec Excerpts**: Your story can feature snippets of the OEP specification (or “RFC”), official white papers, or mandatory compliance checklists.  
   - **Policy Enforcers**: Agencies or committees that certify or decertify enclaved services, plus a public ledger showing who is compliant.

## 2. Setting the Stage and Tone

1. **Time Period**  
   - Near future (e.g., 2030–2040) or an alternate present. Establish how long it’s been since OEP was passed.  
   - Early chapters might show the chaotic transitional period—companies racing to rewrite code in open-source, data centers upgrading hardware, etc.

2. **Global vs. National**  
   - Some countries fully onboard (US, EU, allies).  
   - Others are “rogues” or partially resistant (e.g. China might insist on its own version of the secure enclaves, refusing to open TikTok code thoroughly).  
   - Smaller nations might become enclaves of black-market servers, ignoring the new laws to attract certain businesses or illegal activity.

3. **Theme and Mood**  
   - **Optimistic Techno-Realism**: On one hand, the enclaves *work* at preventing the worst hacks, producing new forms of user trust, and ending the era of secret data exploitation.  
   - **Lingering Skepticism**: On the other hand, some suspect enclaves are “the perfect prison”—once locked in, code is unstoppable if it’s malicious at the hardware level.  
   - **Social Impact**: Are citizens more confident and trusting, or do they worry that transparency kills privacy in other ways? (E.g., you can see exactly *which* code is collecting data about you, but your data might still be aggregated for surveillance.)

## 3. Main Characters and Perspectives

Protocol fiction thrives on multi-perspective storytelling rather than a single hero’s journey. Consider focusing on at least three stakeholder groups:

1. **The Regulators / Policy Designers**  
   - Government officials, NGO advocates, or standards-body engineers who wrote the OEP. They embody the system’s *intentions*—privacy, data protection, fairness.  
   - Internal debates: Did they push the standard too far? Are they ignoring small businesses that can’t afford enclaves? Any suspicious lobbying or carve-outs?

2. **The Corporate / Tech Giants**  
   - A cloud-computing giant forced to open-source their entire infrastructure.  
   - Tensions with their shareholders about losing “secret sauce.”  
   - Celebrations if it wins them user trust, or regrets that competition can replicate their code.  
   - Possibly a “rogue” faction that tries to embed hidden code inside the enclave anyway.

3. **Everyday Citizens / Influencers / Socialites**  
   - A social media influencer now faced with the question: “Should I trust an open-sourced TikTok competitor, or do I stay with the black-market original TikTok which is not enclave-compliant but has the bigger audience?”  
   - Ordinary people might feel safer about their banking, healthcare data, etc., yet remain anxious about unstoppable “smart enclaves” rummaging through personal data in ways they can’t actually see (even if the code is open, not everyone can understand it).

4. **Rogue Actors / Underground**  
   - Hackers testing the “unhackable” enclaves.  
   - Black-hat services that run on Tor, ignoring OEP entirely (like classic “dark web” markets).  
   - Rival countries or extremist groups that see forced transparency as Western digital imperialism and vow to circumvent it.

By letting your story hop between these groups (e.g., short vignettes, interviews, epistolary documents, or more traditional chapters from each POV), you can illustrate the system’s complexity.

## 4. World-Building Through the Protocol Lens

1. **Formalizing the Protocol**  
   - A “Protocol White Paper” chapter that lays out the fundamentals of the Open Enclave Protocol—compliance checkpoints, cryptographic attestation, open-source requirements, etc.  
   - Scenes or interludes from standards meetings (the “OEP Council” plus industry reps) hammering out specific rule sets.

2. **Adoption Timeline and Key Milestones**  
   - *Initial Pilot Phase*: A small region (e.g., parts of the EU) mandates enclaves for government services.  
   - *Global Ratification*: The US signs a treaty after repeated data-harvesting scandals.  
   - *Industry Scramble*: Tech companies open massive GitHub repositories with once-secret code. Journalists comb them for hidden revelations.  
   - *User Reaction*: Some rejoice that it’s the end of data exploitation, others fear losing “convenient but shady” apps.

3. **Economic, Cultural, and Political Consequences**  
   - **Economic**:  
     - Surge in open-source development. New business models revolve around “trust-based services.”  
     - Controversies about whether smaller companies can afford the specialized enclave hardware.  
   - **Cultural**:  
     - “Transparency mania” or “transparency fatigue.” People are simultaneously relieved and overwhelmed by so much open code.  
     - In social media, digital “brand ambassadors” flaunt their platform’s code audits as a mark of legitimacy.  
   - **Political**:  
     - Nations argue over who manufactures the secure enclave chips (intel? TSMC?). Potential for supply chain sabotage.  
     - Countries that refuse the protocol become digital pariahs or black-hat havens, raising moral and geopolitical questions.

4. **Security vs. Freedom Debate**  
   - With enclaves, it’s presumably safer—yet some argue that once everything is forced into a single “trusted” pipeline, society loses resilience.  
   - The tension escalates if a rumored exploit is discovered in the enclave firmware—undermining the entire global system.

## 5. Plot Arcs and Conflict Points

1. **Arc 1: Establishment and Rollout**  
   - Show the impetus—repeated hacks, cross-border data controversies, popular protests.  
   - The legislative drama: how the OEP is passed or recognized globally.  
   - Early adopters vs. holdouts. The first wave of celebratory success stories and press coverage (“At last! We can see the code behind our social networks!”).

2. **Arc 2: Consolidation and Tension**  
   - Suddenly, daily life is changing. Big Tech rebrands. The influencer’s dilemma: do they join a fully transparent platform with fewer followers, or stay with shady enclaveless apps?  
   - Emergence of black market enclaves or Tor-based enclaves that aren’t subject to official audits.  
   - *Possible subplot*: Certain countries build “forked enclaves” with subtle differences in hardware, raising trust issues.  

3. **Arc 3: Crisis of Trust**  
   - A major public scandal: an apparently “verifiably open” service is found to be collecting data surreptitiously via an exploit. The entire public questions: “Are enclaves truly safe?”  
   - Tensions escalate between global powers. Possibly a confrontation with a major player like China, refusing full compliance for apps like TikTok.  
   - Social/political protests, or sabotage by hackers hoping to demonstrate that no system is perfect.

4. **Arc 4: Adaptation or Failure**  
   - Key forks in the system: Maybe the OEP enforcers revise the protocol with new measures.  
   - Countries come to the table for a re-negotiation or face sanctions.  
   - Grassroots movements propose a “people’s open-source hardware” to break corporate lock on enclaves.  
   - Does the system evolve to address discovered flaws, or does it fracture into enclaves and anti-enclaves—creating a world split between official “white net” and illicit “dark enclaves”?

5. **Arc 5: Conclusion and Reflection**  
   - Show how everyday life has changed. Are people overall more trusting—knowing code can be examined? Or is there a deeper cynicism that “open code doesn’t matter if no one truly audits it”?  
   - An epilogue that glimpses future expansions: new breakthroughs in fully verified computing vs. a growing underbelly of “code pirates.”

## 6. Narrative Technique and Format

1. **Multi-Strand, Systemic Storytelling**  
   - Borrow from the “Apocalyptic Systems Thriller” or documentary style with short chapters spotlighting different angles.  
   - Keep the protocol at the center: whenever you shift perspective, show how that vantage point experiences (or tries to circumvent) the secure enclave rules.

2. **Epistolary Artifacts**  
   - Include “in-world” documents:  
     - A snippet from the “Global Enclave Compliance Act (GECA)”  
     - A press release from an OEP oversight board  
     - A black-market advertisement for “Certified Fake Attestation Keys”  
     - User feedback forms from early adopters  
   - These can break up the main text and provide realism.

3. **Character-Driven Vignettes**  
   - Personalize the protocol’s impact through small-scale stories:  
     - A mother who’s relieved that her medical records are *finally* secure from leaks.  
     - A teenage influencer outraged they can’t go viral on the official networks, so they pivot to the illicit “No Enclave” realm on Tor.  
     - A technician who used to sell zero-day exploits but now struggles because enclaves are (almost) unbreakable.

## 7. The Big Social Questions

1. **Trust vs. Fear**  
   - Are people comforted by transparency or unnerved that *everything* is standardized in this single “trusted” pipeline?  
   - New phenomenon: “Security Theater 2.0,” where enclaves *look* foolproof but might hide unseen flaws.

2. **Openness vs. Corporate Secrecy**  
   - How do businesses innovate if all code is open? Do they pivot to “service-based” differentiation?  
   - Does open code truly empower smaller devs, or do giant corporations still hold power through patents on the enclave hardware?

3. **Global Adoption vs. Fragmentation**  
   - Do all countries eventually join the OEP, or do we end up with a balkanized internet?  
   - Tech-savvy users in rogue states might try to “fake compliance,” leading to a cat-and-mouse dynamic.

4. **Surveillance and Human Rights**  
   - Governments can see exactly how companies use data. But can governments also leverage enclaves to run unstoppable surveillance code?  
   - Encryption vs. mandated transparency: how do personal freedoms stand up in a world where the protocol’s watchers might have broad powers?

## 8. Potential Scenes to Illustrate the Protocol World

- **Parliament Hearing**: Show lawmakers grilling a representative from a massive social media platform about compliance.  
- **Factory Tour**: A visit to a chip factory building the secure enclave processors, unveiling the insane complexities and potential backdoors in hardware.  
- **Influencer Livestream**: A star tries to broadcast on a newly certified open-source platform. Chat floods with commentary about “No more hidden algorithms—this kills your brand’s reach!”  
- **Hackers’ Forum**: Hidden on the dark web, discussing rumors of an “unpatchable exploit” in the enclave firmware.  
- **Public Protest**: People marching in the streets: “Stop Government Overreach—My Data, My Choice!” in response to forced open-source.

## 9. Writing (and Co-Writing with AI) Tips

1. **Define Your Protocol Bible**  
   - Keep a concise document of the OEP’s essential points: hardware enclaves, open-source requirements, legal enforcement, etc.  
   - Refer to it whenever you or an AI co-writer risk contradicting established facts.

2. **Use Document-Based Storytelling**  
   - Interleave formal texts (press releases, policy statements) with personal narratives to keep the “system” in the spotlight.

3. **Prompting Strategies** (if collaborating with an LLM)  
   - Provide the AI with the bullet-point rules of your enclaved world. Ask it to generate vignettes or “what if?” scenarios.  
   - Switch roles: have the AI pretend to be a user, a regulator, a black-hat hacker. Compile the results.  
   - Edit for consistency and weave the best pieces into a cohesive story arc.

4. **Embrace the Systemic Focus**  
   - Keep reminding yourself: the *rules* are the protagonist as much as the people are. Show how the enclaves and open-source demands shape society’s behaviors at every turn.

5. **Iterate and Experiment**  
   - Protocol fiction is about exploring consequences. Don’t worry about writing a single linear plot from the start—test multiple angles, see which narrative threads best illustrate your core ideas, and refine from there.

## 10. Possible Endpoints and Open Questions

- **Does the Protocol Ultimately Succeed?**  
  - Maybe it ushers in a new golden age of verified trust, unleashing further radical transparency.  
  - Or fractious geopolity dooms the system to partial adoption, resulting in a “split network” world.

- **Human Element**  
  - Do individuals feel safer, or does the “open code” ironically result in new forms of exploitation by those who know how to read and manipulate it?  
  - Is there a generational shift—older folks relieved by newly minted security laws, while digital natives resent the constant oversight?

- **Sequel Hook**  
  - Introduce the possibility of next-level enclaves or emergent AI-based governance.  
  - A final question: “Are we heading toward a single global standard of computing or drifting into a thousand stealth enclaves?”

## Concluding Note

This framework is designed to help you anchor your story in the heart of protocol fiction: a system of rules (in this case, universal confidential computing enclaves and open-source code) that reshapes society. By sketching out the protocol’s technical and regulatory details, showing its adoption from multiple angles, and dramatizing the resulting social, political, and personal tensions, you’ll create a world where the *rules* are the primary engine of the plot.

Use this outline to begin drafting scenes, scattering official documents and real-time conflicts among your characters. Above all, keep asking: *How does mandatory transparency change daily life, politics, trust, and power?* That question will fuel each chapter—and define how your story explores a future shaped by unhackable enclaves and unstoppable open-source code.
