# **Analysis of Protocol Fiction and AI-Assisted Writing**

## **1. Key Insights from Provided Resources**

### **Protocol Fiction for Speculative Infrastructure (Matt Webb)**
Matt Webb introduces *protocol fiction* as a form of speculative writing that envisions new infrastructural protocols and how they might be adopted in the future ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=So%20last%20year%20I%20wrote,that%20fiction%20is%20to%20articulate)). Instead of focusing on gadgets or user scenarios (as in traditional design fiction), protocol fiction imagines a **network of actors with aligned incentives**, and spells out the *rules or standards (protocols)* that allow a new system to grow “like the internet” ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20end%20up,government%20or%20a%20giant%20corporation)) ([Who could write protocol fiction for speculative infrastructure? (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/08/11/casi#:~:text=So%E2%80%A6%20the%20internet%20works%3F%20How,did%20that%20start)). The goal is to articulate **“belief”** – a plausible path to implementation of a minimum viable network – and **“desire”** – a compelling visualization of the future that people *want* to be part of ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=So%20last%20year%20I%20wrote,that%20fiction%20is%20to%20articulate)). In other words, a protocol fiction story should make the reader both believe in the feasibility of a new protocol and desire the world it would create.

Webb’s essays (2022 and 2023) argue that such fiction can help overcome “stop-energy” – the inertia or skepticism that prevents new big ideas from taking off ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=It%20shifted%20my%20pov,to%20facilitate%20and%20to%20garden)). By telling a convincing story of how a protocol could start small and gain adoption, the fiction provides a narrative blueprint for real-world development ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=So%20last%20year%20I%20wrote,that%20fiction%20is%20to%20articulate)). For example, Webb muses about a national drone delivery network or an ecosystem of AI-based health screenings, and asks: how could these be built by communities rather than corporations ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=How%20could%20you%20end%20up,government%20or%20a%20giant%20corporation))? The answer lies in *showing the process* in fiction: how a few initial nodes cooperate, how the protocol guarantees interoperability and growth, and what incentives draw others in ([Who could write protocol fiction for speculative infrastructure? (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/08/11/casi#:~:text=To%20bootstrap%20this%2C%20a%20%E2%80%9Cminimum,version%20of%20the%20protocol%20stack)). This makes protocol fiction a tool for **“designing for the world as it *should* be”** – a normative design practice much like design fiction ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=Not%20all%20design%20is%20the,the%20world%20of%20normative%20design)). Where design fiction uses speculative prototypes to *“suspend disbelief about change”* ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=The%20practice%20of%20Design%20Fiction,charismatic%20visions%20of%20the%20future)), protocol fiction extends this to the level of systems and standards. It’s inherently *ideological*: envisioning better collective infrastructures, not just isolated products ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=Not%20all%20design%20is%20the,the%20world%20of%20normative%20design)).

*Analysis:* Webb’s concept highlights a powerful use of fiction as a sandbox for innovation. By blending imaginative storytelling with concrete technical and social details, protocol fiction occupies a niche between sci-fi and white paper. Its implications for creativity are significant: writers become system designers, and stories become incubators for real projects. This suggests a shift in creative writing – from solely character and plot, to *networks, rules, and emergent behaviors* as narrative elements. The perspective empowers writers (and readers) to think of **institutions and protocols as characters** in their own right, deserving as much attention as heroes and villains. It also aligns with optimistic or constructive science fiction, countering the common trope of institutions as mere antagonists. In fact, others have noted that early sci-fi often celebrated protocols (e.g. Asimov’s *Three Laws of Robotics* are essentially fictional protocols), whereas later dystopias painted bureaucracies as villains ([The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols Web - Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/the-unreasonable-sufficiency-of-protocols-web#:~:text=Science%20fiction%20in%20particular%2C%20has,stories%20as%20the%20human%20protagonists)) ([The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols Web - Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/the-unreasonable-sufficiency-of-protocols-web#:~:text=Idiots%2C26%20%20this%20changed,32)). Webb and colleagues argue that reversing this trend – making *systems* intriguing and even heroic – is vital in an increasingly “protocolized” world ([The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols Web - Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/the-unreasonable-sufficiency-of-protocols-web#:~:text=curiosity%20via%20good%20storytelling%20is,27)). The implication for writers is to explore new kinds of narratives that inspire collective action. However, a challenge in this approach is maintaining a gripping story while explaining technical details. Webb’s answer is to embed the *human element of desire*: show people why the protocol makes life better, not just how it works ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=%2A%20belief%20,compelling%20visualisation%20of%20this%20future)). This blend of engineering and empathy is what makes protocol fiction uniquely creative.

### **“AI + Protocols” Fiction Workshop (Protocolized/Summer of Protocols)**
Another resource details a recent experiment: a workshop where writers **co-created protocol fiction with AI assistance** ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues)). In this Austin-based workshop, participants set out to *“use interesting protocols to write fiction, and/or write fiction about protocols”* ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20in%20Austin%2C%20Protocolized,and%20helped%20facilitate%20the%20workshop)). Practically, this meant two things: **writing about protocols** (thematic focus) and **writing with protocols** (process focus). The process involved incorporating **LLMs (Large Language Models)** as co-authors in a structured way. Over a week, a group of ~10 writers met for two co-working sessions (kickoff and finale) with asynchronous collaboration in between ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues)). In the kickoff, they brainstormed story ideas and decided on an experimental approach: each story would be co-written with AI in some creative manner ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues)). During the week, they collaborated on Discord, and at the final session they shared drafts and compared notes on their “LLM-assisted writing protocols” ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues)).

The **outcomes** were striking. The group produced five rough draft stories, and found the quality “surprisingly good” ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=The%20drafts%20were%20surprisingly%20good%2C,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)). Participants tried various co-writing methods:
- Using an LLM for outlining the story, then the human fleshing it out (or vice versa) ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=The%20drafts%20were%20surprisingly%20good%2C,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)).
- **Turn-taking writing**: human and AI alternating sentences or story beats, following an improv-like rule (e.g. always accepting and building on the previous line) ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=The%20drafts%20were%20surprisingly%20good%2C,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)).
- Chaining models: for example, generating text with one AI (Anthropic’s *Claude*) then feeding that to another AI (OpenAI’s *ChatGPT*) to iterate, and back again ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=using%20LLMs%20for%20outlining%2C%20fleshing,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)). 

Each technique was essentially a different **collaborative “protocol” for writing**, and each yielded unique insights and styles in the output ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=using%20LLMs%20for%20outlining%2C%20fleshing,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)). The *“big lesson”*, as the facilitators note, is that treating the AI **“as an equal partner in the creative process”** – and being inventive with the co-authorship rules – leads to *“fascinating effects.”* ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=and%20back,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)) Rather than using AI just for quick fixes or autocomplete, the writers engaged it like a colleague, which often took the story in unexpected, inspired directions.

This resource not only provides proof-of-concept that AI-assisted protocol fiction can work, but also offers a **positive perspective on AI in creativity**. The editorial team behind the workshop was so encouraged that they announced a plan to *“lean into AI-assisted ‘protocol fiction about protocols’”* – even preferring to publish stories that have at least 30% of their content generated by an AI ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,help%20develop%20this%20nascent%20scene)). This is a bold stance pushing the boundaries of literary experimentation. It suggests the emergence of a *“brave new genre”* where human imagination and machine generation intertwine, much like how photography once expanded art ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20hope%2C%20with%20these%20two,genre%20of%20creative%20writing%20here)).

*Analysis:* The workshop’s experiences underscore both the **potential and the nuances** of AI-assisted writing. On one hand, the success of those drafts demonstrates concrete benefits: speed and surprise. Writers found that AI contributions could inject novel ideas and help overcome creative blocks, essentially serving as an “idea generator” or improvisational partner. Some techniques (like alternating lines) introduced a playful unpredictability – the human had to adapt to whatever the AI said, and vice versa, which can lead to inventive plot twists. This highlights a key implication: **writing becomes a dialogue**, not a solitary act. It can make the process more fun and social, even when the “partner” is an AI. 

On the other hand, the need for well-defined **protocols in using the AI** is telling. Without structure, AI generation could easily go off track or produce incoherent text. By setting rules (e.g. one sentence each, or sticking to an outline), humans guide the AI and maintain creative control. This reflects an important balance: the human writers are *curators* of the AI’s creativity. The workshop outcome affirms that when done thoughtfully, AI assistance doesn’t have to dilute human creativity – in fact, it can amplify it. But it also implies a learning curve: writers must experiment with different collaborative methods to discover what “mix” of AI and human input yields the best result. It’s notable that the organizers compare the rise of AI co-writing to the advent of a *“meta-medium”* like cinema or comics in the past ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20hope%2C%20with%20these%20two,genre%20of%20creative%20writing%20here)). This frames AI-assisted fiction as not just a gimmick, but a new medium of storytelling. However, skeptics (including many established writers) worry about “AI slop” flooding the literary world ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=catalyze%20a%20whole%20new%20creative,genre%20of%20creative%20writing%20here)). The workshop’s evidence provides a counterpoint: quality *can* emerge from human-AI teams if the process is managed with creative intention. It invites further exploration into co-writing protocols that ensure the end product is artful and coherent, not just auto-generated noise.

### **AI-Assisted Writing Tools and Perspectives**
A third resource (among the provided links) likely discussed the broader use of AI in writing – for example, an article or essay on using large language models like GPT-4 or tools like Sudowrite to assist authors. One such perspective is that of writers using **GPT-based assistants as “copilots”** in the writing process. For instance, *Stanislav Stankovic* in *“ChatGPT is My Copilot”* (Medium, 2023) and *Alex Gostev* in his blog (2025) both describe how AI can boost productivity but also warn of its pitfalls. A recurring argument is that while AI can generate text rapidly, it often lacks originality. Gostev points out that fully letting an AI “take the wheel” leads to *bland* results: *“AI writing tools produce content that’s technically correct but creatively bankrupt. They mimic the average of everything they’ve seen.”* ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=AI%20writing%20tools%20produce%20content,technically%20correct%20but%20creatively%20bankrupt)). This resonates with many authors’ experiences that naive use of GPT yields generic prose and clichés. The AI’s strength is in **pattern recognition** (predicting likely next words), not in true innovation or deep contextual insight ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=What%20most%20discussions%20about%20AI,What%27s%20typical)). 

However, these writers also outline **collaboration models** where AI serves as a helpful assistant rather than a replacement. For example, Gostev identifies three models that preserve the human’s creative voice ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=After%20months%20of%20experimentation%2C%20I%27ve,that%20preserve%20your%20creative%20sovereignty)) ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=3)):
- *Research Assistant:* The human decides the topic and narrative direction, the AI fetches facts or background info, then the human writes the draft and maybe uses AI for minor edits ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=1)) ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=You%3A%20Define%20the%20topic%20and,rough%20edges%20and%20awkward%20phrasing)).
- *Idea Expander:* The human provides a concept or paragraph, the AI offers variations or different angles, and the human picks the compelling pieces to integrate ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=2)).
- *First Draft Partner:* The human crafts a detailed outline, the AI turns it into a draft, and then the human heavily revises that draft to add personal style and insights ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=AI%3A%20Generate%20multiple%20perspectives%20on,thoughts%20into%20a%20cohesive%20whole)).

In all these scenarios, **the human remains the “director”** of the piece ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=The%20key%20in%20all%20three,another%20tool%20in%20your%20kit)). The benefit is efficiency (these methods can save time on drudge work or overcome writer’s block), but the human ensures the final content isn’t soulless. This view is echoed by Sudowrite’s founders and others: AI can suggest what’s “typical,” but the writer must decide what is *meaningful* or original. Indeed, a piece of research in *Nature* found that human-AI hybrid teams produce more innovative results than AI alone *or* human alone – *“but only when humans maintain creative control.”* ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=When%20every%20company%20uses%20similar,similar%20prompts%2C%20market%20differentiation%20collapses)). That is, the best outcomes occur when AI is used as a **tool** under human guidance, not as an autonomous author.

Another insight from these discussions is the emotional or psychological aspect of co-writing. The Stanford **CoAuthor** experiment (2022) studied how writers feel and perform when collaborating with GPT-3. Interestingly, they found that increased AI involvement did **not** significantly reduce writers’ satisfaction with the process, but it did affect their sense of authorship – some felt less ownership of the text when many sentences came from the AI ([Meet CoAuthor, an Experiment in Human-AI Collaborative Writing](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/meet-coauthor-experiment-human-ai-collaborative-writing#:~:text=Lee%20found%20that%20the%20degree,new%20ideas%20from%20the%20model)). On the positive side, participants enjoyed the AI’s suggestions and *“taking new ideas from the model.”* ([Meet CoAuthor, an Experiment in Human-AI Collaborative Writing](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/meet-coauthor-experiment-human-ai-collaborative-writing#:~:text=Lee%20found%20that%20the%20degree,new%20ideas%20from%20the%20model)) It was reported that using the AI **increased productivity** (more words written, faster output) and even improved mechanical quality (fewer spelling/grammar errors in co-written sentences) ([Meet CoAuthor, an Experiment in Human-AI Collaborative Writing](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/meet-coauthor-experiment-human-ai-collaborative-writing#:~:text=CoAuthor%E2%80%99s%20creators%20also%20found%20that,to%20have%20fewer%20spelling%20and)). These findings show that AI assistance can make writing more efficient, but it introduces a new dynamic: writing becomes a *shared* task, which might dilute the singular pride of creation for some authors. The trade-off between efficiency and a personal sense of creativity is something each writer may balance differently.

*Analysis:* The perspectives on AI-assisted writing reveal a spectrum from enthusiastic adoption to cautious skepticism. On one end, tools like **Sudowrite** position AI as a boon to authors – helping manage complex storylines, generating descriptive passages on cue, or avoiding clichés by offering alternative phrasing. The founder James Yu has described how features like the “Story Engine” let writers input their outline and have the AI draft scenes, which they can then refine ([From Fiction to Reality: AI-assisted Creative Writing](https://humanloop.com/blog/ai-assisted-creative-writing#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%2C%20we%20dive,build%20a%20community%20of%20users)) ([From Fiction to Reality: AI-assisted Creative Writing](https://humanloop.com/blog/ai-assisted-creative-writing#:~:text=10%3A23%20,Closing%20Thoughts)). This can empower writers to tackle large novels by delegating some of the heavy lifting to the AI, almost like having a junior co-writer. The backlash and debate in the writing community – some fear it’s cheating or that it will homogenize literature – shows the cultural tension around this technology ([From Fiction to Reality: AI-assisted Creative Writing](https://humanloop.com/blog/ai-assisted-creative-writing#:~:text=assistant%20for%20novelists%2C%20helping%20writers,build%20a%20community%20of%20users)) ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=catalyze%20a%20whole%20new%20creative,genre%20of%20creative%20writing%20here)). Many established writers emphasize the sanctity of human creativity, worrying that over-reliance on AI could erode writing skills or the authenticity of voice.

The pragmatic middle-ground view that emerges from the resources is: **AI is best used as an extension of the writer, not a replacement.** It excels at certain tasks (generating fluent text quickly, providing variations, recalling information), which can free humans to focus on higher-level creative decisions. But left unchecked, it tends toward the mean – the average style or the obvious plot – which can flatten the creative spark. Therefore, the implication is that *using AI in writing is a skill in itself.* Prompting effectively, curating outputs, and integrating them into a coherent, original piece requires practice and discernment. It’s comparable to an editor or a writing partner who has a vast but generalized knowledge of language. 

For creativity, this means a new form of craftsmanship: the writer becomes a **designer of a process**, orchestrating when to use AI and when to deviate from it. In protocol fiction specifically, AI might help by quickly drafting technical descriptions or exploring the implications of a proposed protocol, while the human author ensures the story stays engaging and believable. One can also see challenges: for instance, maintaining consistency of tone and character with AI involvement can be hard – the AI might introduce inconsistencies that the author needs to fix. There’s also the question of originality: if everyone uses the same few AI models, will stories start to feel same-ish? This is why some voices like Gostev stress not falling into the “efficiency trap” of accepting AI output without personalization ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=That%27s%20when%20I%20realized%20,thing%20readers%20want%3A%20my%20perspective)) ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=They%20mimic%20the%20average%20of,%E2%80%93%20nothing%20more%2C%20nothing%20less)). The value of these perspectives is in showing *how* to harness AI’s benefits (speed, scale, surprise) while guarding against its weaknesses (generic style, lack of true insight). Ultimately, for writers and workshop participants, understanding these trade-offs is crucial to use AI as a **creative ally** and not a crutch.

## **2. Broader Perspectives and Research**

### **Protocol Fiction in Literature and Theory**
The idea of *protocol-focused fiction* can be contextualized within a broader literary and design tradition. While the term is new, the concept has roots in **design fiction** and **speculative fiction**. Design fiction, a practice defined by futurist Julian Bleecker and popularized by Bruce Sterling, involves creating *“diegetic prototypes”* – fictional artifacts presented within a story to help people envision how a future technology might change everyday life ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=The%20practice%20of%20Design%20Fiction,charismatic%20visions%20of%20the%20future)). Protocol fiction can be seen as a natural evolution: the prototype here is not a gadget but a *system of rules or a network*. It’s about prototyping social and technical protocols in narrative form. This aligns with what some scholars call *“normative design”* ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=Not%20all%20design%20is%20the,the%20world%20of%20normative%20design)) – designing artifacts (or scenarios) that explicitly aim for a preferred future, not just reflecting current conditions. By writing a story where a new protocol solves a problem or enables new forms of cooperation, the author is effectively **prototyping a future institution** in a safe, fictional sandbox.

Historically, elements of protocol fiction appear in classic science fiction. As noted in the *Summer of Protocols* research, Isaac Asimov’s famous **Three Laws of Robotics** can be viewed as a fictional protocol – a set of rules governing robot behavior that shaped an entire fictional universe ([The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols Web - Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/the-unreasonable-sufficiency-of-protocols-web#:~:text=Science%20fiction%20in%20particular%2C%20has,stories%20as%20the%20human%20protagonists)). Asimov used those laws to explore ethical and social dynamics, essentially using fiction to test a protocol’s implications (e.g., in *I, Robot* stories, when the laws lead to conflicts or unexpected outcomes). Another Asimov concept, *psychohistory* from the *Foundation* series, is a fictional scientific protocol for predicting society’s trajectory. These are early examples where the *idea of a system of rules* was central to the narrative. 

In mid-20th-century sci-fi, one also finds stories where bureaucracies or procedural systems are at the heart of the plot (e.g., Stanislaw Lem’s novel *“Memoirs Found in a Bathtub”*, which is a satirical take on an all-encompassing bureaucracy). However, as society’s view of institutions turned cynical in the late 20th century, many stories cast protocols and institutions in a negative light. Author David Brin, in a 2013 essay, observed that modern sci-fi often defaults to *“a world filled with idiots”* in authority – meaning the **institutional systems are portrayed as inept or oppressive** ([The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols Web - Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/the-unreasonable-sufficiency-of-protocols-web#:~:text=Sometime%20during%20the%20past%20few,interesting%20challenge%2C%20explored%20in%20another)). The lone rebel or rogue AI is the hero instead. This “anti-protocol” trope, while resonant in cyberpunk and dystopias, arguably limits imaginative possibilities for cooperative futures. In response, critics like Merve Emre have talked about *“bureaucratic heroism”* – the notion that stories could actually celebrate the heroism of doing bureaucracy or protocol well ([The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols Web - Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/the-unreasonable-sufficiency-of-protocols-web#:~:text=operating%20on%20the%20margins%20and,27)). Think of a narrative where the protagonists are civil servants or coders heroically making a new protocol work for the public good, rather than mavericks tearing the system down.

Protocol fiction, as advocated by Webb and the Summer of Protocols, is very much in this spirit of **redeeming the role of protocols** in our collective imagination. It challenges writers to craft engaging stories where the *protocol itself is a character*: it has to navigate obstacles (adoption hurdles, design flaws, social pushback) and evolve, and it ultimately benefits the community if “good” triumphs. Such fiction aligns with optimistic subgenres like **solarpunk**, which imagines sustainable future societies with community-centric innovations. In solarpunk stories, one might see descriptions of new energy-sharing networks or local decision-making frameworks – essentially positive protocols – that enable the utopian elements. Where protocol fiction might differ is an even more explicit focus on the *mechanics* of those systems. It’s not just the ambiance of a better future, but a play-by-play of how a new *rule-set* gains legitimacy.

Academically, one might also draw parallels with **procedural literature** or the OuLiPo movement (Ouvroir de littérature potentielle). In the 1960s, OuLiPo writers like Georges Perec and Italo Calvino set arbitrary constraints (protocols) for their writing – e.g., writing a novel without using the letter “e”, or with a predetermined pattern. They treated constraints as inspiration for creativity. While their goal was more about form than world-building, the underlying ethos is similar: *rules can spark creativity, rather than hinder it*. Protocol fiction similarly suggests that adhering to the logic of a designed system (say, an economic protocol in a story) can generate creative tension and originality, as opposed to all stories following the same human-drama tropes.

It’s worth noting there may be skepticism or challenges to protocol fiction. Some traditional storytellers might worry that focusing on abstract systems could make a story dry or didactic. There’s a risk that the “message” (advocating a protocol) overtakes the narrative, turning it into a thinly veiled proposal. A balance must be struck so that **characters and human stakes** remain front and center, with the protocol serving as the fascinating backdrop or catalyst. When done well, though, this approach can produce very thought-provoking fiction. For example, **Ted Chiang** (a contemporary sci-fi author) often writes stories that revolve around a logical or scientific premise that characters must grapple with – one could consider some of his works as exploring protocols of nature or society. His story “The Lifecycle of Software Objects” deals with raising AI pets and implicitly the protocols of AI rights and ownership. These aren’t labeled protocol fiction, but they show that deeply exploring a set of rules and their consequences can yield compelling narratives.

In summary, broader literary perspectives both support and challenge protocol fiction. There is a lineage of works that demonstrate its viability (from Asimov’s systemic laws to modern optimistic sci-fi), and also a prevailing trend of distrust in systems that protocol fiction seeks to counter. As our lives become more governed by algorithms, networks, and standards (think of internet protocols, social media policies, blockchain smart contracts), **fiction that critically and creatively examines protocols** is increasingly relevant. It encourages not just technologists but everyone to consider: “What if the way we *organize* could be different?” and plays that out in story form. Academic interest in this might grow, bridging computer science, sociology, and creative writing – much like how cyberpunk bridged tech and fiction in the 1980s. Protocol fiction could become a tool for interdisciplinary dialogue, using narrative as a way to test policy ideas or collaborative frameworks before they are built for real.

### **Advances and Examples in AI-Assisted Creative Writing**
Beyond the initial resources, there’s a growing body of examples and research on **AI-assisted fiction writing**. We’ve already touched on some (Sudowrite, CoAuthor, etc.), but consider a few notable case studies and perspectives:

- **Co-Writing a Novel with AI:** Science fiction author *Yudhanjaya Wijeratne* co-wrote a novel titled *“The Salvage Crew”* (2020) with the help of AI tools. His process involved using a language model to generate prose and even poetry within the book, which he then curated and edited ([Co-writing With Artificial Intelligence With Yudhanjaya Wijeratne | The Creative Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/01/18/co-writing-with-artificial-intelligence-yudhanjaya/#:~:text=Yudhanjaya%3A%20What%20I%20did%20for,And%20I%27ve%20been)). The novel itself is about humans working alongside an AI overseer – a fitting theme given the writing method ([Co-writing With Artificial Intelligence With Yudhanjaya Wijeratne | The Creative Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/01/18/co-writing-with-artificial-intelligence-yudhanjaya/#:~:text=in%20Sri%20Lanka,the%20help%20of%20AI%20tools)). Readers and reviewers were reportedly unable to tell which parts were AI-generated, especially some of the poetry that the AI produced in the style of the story’s AI character ([Co-writing With Artificial Intelligence With Yudhanjaya Wijeratne | The Creative Penn](https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/01/18/co-writing-with-artificial-intelligence-yudhanjaya/#:~:text=match%20at%20L350%20people%20be,the%20format%20and%20so%20on)). Wijeratne’s example shows that with a careful approach, AI contributions can blend seamlessly into a human narrative voice. The key was that he iteratively guided the AI (providing prompts, selecting from its outputs, and training it on his style) so that the end product felt cohesive. This case also illustrates a benefit: AI can help authors experiment with styles or content they might not naturally create – essentially, it’s a sparring partner for creativity. However, Yudhanjaya has noted in interviews that it’s not a shortcut to an easy novel; it required just as much editing and decision-making as a normal writing process, just with different tasks. 

- **AI-Written Short Story in a Competition:** In 2016, a short novel co-authored by an AI program in Japan made headlines by **passing the first round of a national literary contest** (the Hoshi Shinichi Literary Award). Titled *“The Day a Computer Writes a Novel,”* it was crafted by a human-AI team: the human developers set the plot and characters, and the AI system composed the text from prepared sentences ([Japanese AI Writes a Novel, Nearly Wins Literary Award - Big Think](https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/a-japanese-ai-wrote-a-novel-almost-wins-literary-award/#:~:text=The%20team%20that%20created%20this,to%20autonomously%20%E2%80%9Cwrite%E2%80%9D%20the%20book)). Judges commented that the story was actually well-structured and coherent, though it lacked strong character development ([Japanese AI Writes a Novel, Nearly Wins Literary Award - Big Think](https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/a-japanese-ai-wrote-a-novel-almost-wins-literary-award/#:~:text=A%20science%20fiction%20novelist%20at,shows%20the%20potential%20for%20advancement)). While it didn’t win the prize, this experiment demonstrated early on that AI could participate in creative writing at a level that competes with amateur human writers. It also underscored the collaborative nature – the AI didn’t imagine the whole story from scratch; it worked within parameters given by humans, hinting at the “human at the helm with a computer co-author” model ([Japanese AI Writes a Novel, Nearly Wins Literary Award - Big Think](https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/a-japanese-ai-wrote-a-novel-almost-wins-literary-award/#:~:text=Many%20argue%20that%20while%20these,author)). This example challenged writers to rethink the boundaries of authorship: if an AI can write decently with guidance, then writing becomes more about coaching ideas than typing every word. It also foreshadowed the influx of AI-generated content; today, with tools far more advanced than in 2016, some writing contests and magazines have had to devise policies to handle AI-created submissions.

- **Interactive Fiction and AI:** Another angle is using AI in *interactive storytelling*, like text adventure games or choose-your-own-path stories. Projects like **AI Dungeon** (built on GPT models) allow players to have a dynamic narrative that the AI generates on the fly in response to their actions. While not “co-writing” in the publishing sense, it is a form of real-time collaborative storytelling between a human and AI. The AI Dungeon phenomenon revealed both the strengths and weaknesses of AI in narrative: it can be incredibly *imaginative and flexible*, responding to any input with some continuation of the story, but it can also lose the plot, forget details, or produce absurdities. This has prompted developers to incorporate *protocols in the system* – for example, keeping a memory of past events, or having content filters (to avoid inappropriate outputs). The interactive fiction community’s experiments highlight that, to maintain coherence and enjoyment, some guardrails (again, protocols) are needed when an AI is largely in charge of plot progression. Nonetheless, many users found the collaborative creativity exciting, as it felt like **improvisational theater** with an AI partner.

- **Publishing and the “AI Flood”:** On the flip side of curated, positive uses, there’s the cautionary tale of what happens when AI writing becomes too easy. In early 2023, the sci-fi magazine *Clarkesworld* had to close story submissions temporarily because it was swamped by hundreds of AI-generated stories of low quality (submitted by people hoping to get published or paid) – essentially spam ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=catalyze%20a%20whole%20new%20creative,genre%20of%20creative%20writing%20here)). This scenario shows the **limitations and concerns** around AI-assisted writing: if not used thoughtfully, it can produce a deluge of derivative content that wastes editors’ time and threatens to crowd out original voices. The magazine’s editor noted that the telltale signs of those spam stories were formulaic plots and glitches that made it clear they weren’t genuine, polished fiction. This brings up an important point for workshop discussions: **AI is a tool available to everyone, so the value lies in how you use it**. Simply asking ChatGPT for a short story and sending it off will likely create something dull and universally identifiable (and unethical if passed off as solely one’s own work). The creative challenge is in using AI in a way that adds uniqueness rather than subtracts it.

- **Emerging Practices:** We also see new practices like **“prompt engineering” as a writing skill**. Some writers are sharing prompt strategies to get better storytelling from AI (for example, prompting the AI to take on a persona of a specific kind of writer or to follow a certain style guide). Others use AI to simulate conversations with their characters – literally prompting the model to answer as a character would, to help flesh out dialogues or backstories. These approaches treat the AI almost like an actor improvising in character or a dungeon master in a role-playing game. It’s a burgeoning area of creativity. From a broader perspective, it blurs the line between writer and programmer – crafting the right prompt is akin to writing a mini-script that directs the AI’s performance. 

In light of these examples and research, it’s evident that AI-assisted writing is not a monolith; it spans a range from fully automated content mills to deeply integrated artistic collaborations. The **benefits** across these cases include enhanced productivity, ability to generate content at scale, getting unstuck from writer’s block, and discovering unanticipated ideas. The **limitations** include quality control, the need for substantial human editing, ethical questions of plagiarism (since AI is trained on existing works), and the potential loss of the author’s personal touch if overused. But perhaps the most exciting aspect is seeing writers invent new genres and formats that weren’t possible before. For instance, a group of writers might collectively brainstorm with an AI live in a chat, creating a kind of *crowd-AI hybrid story*. Or an author might release a story with branching paths, each path co-written with the AI exploring a different outcome. These are things that traditional publishing didn’t widely accommodate, but digital platforms and AI open the door to experimentation.

In summary, broader exploration of AI-assisted writing shows a field in flux. The consensus among forward-thinking creators is to **embrace the tool, but stay in control**. In the context of protocol fiction, this means using AI to help imagine complex systems or to quickly prototype scenarios (“What if I tweak this rule – AI, show me a story snippet of the outcome…”), all while the author ensures the story remains coherent and meaningful. It’s an iterative, experimental process – much like protocol design itself. This synergy between the subject (protocols) and the method (protocol-guided co-writing with AI) is what makes the intersection particularly rich for a workshop setting.

## **3. Integrating Concepts into a Workshop**

If we were to design a hands-on **workshop on protocol fiction and AI-assisted writing**, the goal would be to let participants *experience* these ideas in practice. Below is a guide for structuring such a workshop, including exercises and discussion prompts that tie together the insights from above. The emphasis is on experimentation, collaboration, and creativity – making it accessible for newcomers while encouraging seasoned writers to try new methods.

### **Workshop Structure and Setup**
**Format:** A recommended format (inspired by the Austin pilot workshop) is a two-session model:
- **Session 1 (Kickoff, ~3 hours):** Introduce the core concepts of protocol fiction and AI co-writing. Participants then brainstorm story ideas and decide on a “protocol” for their writing process ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues)). This session is also for forming teams or pairs and ensuring everyone has access to the needed tools (e.g. a chosen AI platform like ChatGPT, GPT-4, Sudowrite, etc.). By the end of Session 1, each participant or team should have a story concept and a plan for how they will involve the AI in writing it (their co-writing protocol).
- **Writing Phase (Async, a few days to a week):** Participants work on their stories on their own time, applying the chosen methods. They may share interim progress or cool discoveries in an online channel (e.g. a dedicated Discord or Slack) to keep motivation up ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues)). Optionally, facilitators can schedule a brief check-in midway to address any tool issues or brainstorming needs.
- **Session 2 (Finale, ~3 hours):** Participants reconvene to share their draft stories or excerpts. Each person/team presents how they collaborated with the AI – what techniques they used, what worked or didn’t. This is followed by group discussion reflecting on the experience and what it suggests about writing with AI. If time permits, a fun ending is a rapid “remix” exercise where people swap stories or prompts and do a quick AI-assisted edit on someone else’s piece, just to see a different perspective.

**Group Size and Setup:** Aim for around 8–12 participants, which is small enough for everyone to share but large enough for diverse ideas (the Austin workshop found ~10 to be a functional limit) ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Second%2C%20if%20you%20happen%20to,workshop%2C%20shoot%20us%20an%20email)). Ensure a comfortable space with internet access for Session 1 and 2 (and yes, snacks like pizza or tacos help creativity, as the organizers humorously noted ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=We%20started%20with%20a%203,published%20here%20in%20future%20issues))!). Participants should have accounts set up for whichever AI tools you plan to use. It’s also useful to have a shared online document folder or collaboration space where people can drop their stories or transcripts of their AI interactions if they want to show examples.

**Introduction (for newcomers):** Begin by clearly explaining *what is protocol fiction*. You might say: “It’s like design fiction, but instead of a fancy gadget, the *main idea* is a set of rules or a network that could change how things work.” Give a simple example: *“Imagine a story about a city where everyone uses a community currency. The plot could show how that protocol affects daily life – the good, the conflicts, how it started.”* Emphasize belief and desire: the story should make the protocol seem believable and also show why people would embrace it ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=So%20last%20year%20I%20wrote,that%20fiction%20is%20to%20articulate)). Next, introduce AI-assisted writing: “We’re going to use AI like a writing partner. Think of it as a very eager co-author who has read a million books.” Assure them that no coding is needed, and you’ll provide prompt templates to work with. It’s important to set a positive, experimental tone: the AI might do unexpected things, and that’s part of the fun. Sometimes it will be brilliant, sometimes it will be wrong – both outcomes are insights.

### **Hands-On Exercises and Protocols for Writing**

To engage participants, you can introduce a menu of **writing exercises**. These are structured activities that incorporate AI assistance in various ways. Each exercise can be tied to a principle from the earlier analysis:

- **1. “Improv Ping-Pong” (Turn-Taking with AI):** This exercise pairs a human and the AI in an alternating writing game. The participant writes the first sentence of a story (preferably introducing a character and the protocol or setting). Then they prompt the AI to write the next sentence or paragraph, continuing the story. They go back and forth in this manner. The rule (or protocol) is that *neither the human nor the AI can contradict what the other wrote; they must “yes, and” to build the narrative.* This method forces the human to react to AI-generated ideas and vice versa. It often leads to surprising twists – great for showcasing the AI’s unpredictability. In the workshop, encourage participants to **embrace the unexpected**. For instance, if the AI introduces a sudden problem in the protocol, the human can run with that conflict. After about 5–10 exchanges, they can stop and review the story. *Debrief question:* How different is the story from what you initially expected? Did the protocol element take on a life of its own? Participants will likely note both humorous tangents and inspired ideas that emerged. This exercise highlights the lesson that *structure plus spontaneity = creativity*, echoing the workshop’s finding that co-authoring protocols yield “surprising insights” ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=using%20LLMs%20for%20outlining%2C%20fleshing,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)).

- **2. “Outline and Expand” (AI as First-Draft Partner):** This exercise has two phases. In Phase 1, the participant creates a **detailed outline** for a short story that involves a protocol. For example: *Setting (what future, what protocol exists), Characters (who is involved), Conflict (what goes wrong or what challenge arises around the protocol), Resolution.* They break the story into a few beats or sections in bullet points. In Phase 2, they feed this outline to the AI and ask it to **generate a draft** of the story following that structure. Prompt idea: *“Write a short story based on the outline above. The story is about [protocol X] and should show [desired outcome]. Make it engaging with dialogue and emotion.”* Once the AI produces a draft, the participant then goes through it to **edit and inject their own voice** (this is crucial!). They might rewrite any stiff passages, add a personal anecdote, or adjust the tone. Essentially, the AI handles the heavy lifting of turning outline to prose, and the human polishes it. This exercise demonstrates efficiency gains – how AI can save time on initial drafting – while reinforcing the need for human creativity in revisions ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=You%3A%20Create%20a%20detailed%20outline,with%20final%20edits%20and%20formatting)). *Debrief question:* Did the AI introduce any elements that you hadn’t planned in the outline? (Sometimes it will fill gaps in surprising ways.) Ask if the participant feels the story is “theirs” even though AI wrote the first full draft – touching on that sense-of-ownership issue from research. Most will say yes after revision, since they edited it thoroughly, but it’s a good discussion on authorship.

- **3. “Character Interview via AI”:** This is a more exploratory exercise. The idea is to deepen the story by understanding characters and the protocol better. Participants prompt the AI to **simulate a conversation** with one of their characters. For example: *“You are the AI system governing the drone delivery network (protocol). I am a journalist interviewing you about how you operate and what challenges you face. Let’s have a Q&A.”* – or – *“Act as Helena, a participant in the community currency system. I (the author) will ask you questions about how the first year has been for you.”* This way, the AI’s response will be in the voice of the character or entity, potentially revealing facets that the author hadn’t thought about. It can voice the *desire and belief* from a first-person perspective: e.g., the character might express why they trust (or mistrust) the protocol, bringing out conflict or emotion. Participants can take the interesting snippets from this “interview” and weave them into their narrative, making it richer and more authentic. *Debrief question:* Did the character say something that surprised you or changed how you’ll write them? This exercise trains the skill of prompt-crafting for characterization and shows AI’s strength in role-playing, which can help overcome the challenge of making protocols *personal* in a story.

- **4. **Collaborative Chain Story (Group exercise):** If the group is amenable, try one fully collaborative game. One person starts with a single sentence or tweet-length idea pitching a protocol fiction premise (e.g., *“In this world, every text message costs a dollar that goes to charity – a protocol to curb frivolous talk.”*). Then each participant in turn asks the AI to continue the story from where the last left off. This can be done round-robin in the session, projecting the live AI outputs for everyone to see. Each person might give a unique instruction to the AI (one might say “continue with a twist of mystery,” the next “continue but show a consequence of the protocol”). The story will evolve unpredictably. At the end, the group has a bizarre, multi-authored tale. This is mostly a fun, energizing activity to break any creative ice. It highlights how different styles of prompting lead to different directions in the story, and it’s a visceral demo of the **“iterative loop”** of human-AI writing. Everyone will likely laugh at some wild turn the AI took, and it sets up a discussion on controlling narrative vs. letting it go.

- **5. “Belief and Desire” Sketches:** This exercise ties back to the essence of protocol fiction. Ask participants to write **two short paragraphs** (or have the AI help write them) separately: one that focuses on *belief* and one on *desire*. For the **belief** paragraph, they should describe a plausible scenario of the protocol being implemented – like a mini history or news report of how it started and grew. For the **desire** paragraph, they should paint an attractive picture of daily life or a scene in the future where the protocol has made something better. They can use the AI to assist in either or both, for example: *“Describe a utopian morning in a city where the self-governed transit protocol makes commuting effortless.”* Once both are written, they then incorporate those elements into their story (or at least compare if their story drafts hit both notes). This exercise ensures they are considering the two key ingredients Webb mentioned ([Protocol Fiction, Desire, and Belief (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/05/19/protocols#:~:text=%2A%20belief%20,compelling%20visualisation%20of%20this%20future)). It’s particularly useful for participants who might lean too heavy either on technical detail (belief) or on utopian flourish (desire) – it reminds them to balance the two. In discussion, emphasize how the most compelling stories had a mix: they felt *credible* and *captivating*. If any participant struggled with one of the two, others can suggest how to improve it (maybe using an AI to generate ideas they didn’t think of).

Throughout these exercises, it’s important to circulate (if you’re the facilitator) and check in with participants. Some might hit snags like the AI output getting repetitive or not following instructions well. These become coaching moments: you can advise them to be more specific in prompts, or even to take a break from AI and write a few lines themselves to steer the direction back. Remind them that **they control the protocol of interaction** – if a method isn’t yielding good results, tweak the rules or try a different one.

### **Discussion and Reflection**

After the hands-on writing, a **group discussion** helps consolidate what everyone learned. Here are a few guided discussion points or questions:

- **“What surprised you?”** – Each person can share an unexpected thing that happened during writing. Perhaps the AI introduced a plot development that they decided to keep because it was genuinely interesting. Or maybe using a constraint (like the ping-pong) resulted in a tone or style they wouldn’t normally write. This is a chance to highlight creative serendipity. Often, these surprises are the “fascinating effects” that only emerge from *human+AI* collaboration, not from either alone ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=and%20back,end%20up%20with%20fascinating%20effects)).

- **“How did the AI change your writing process?”** – Some may say it helped them write faster, others that it allowed them to focus more on ideas while the AI handled wording. Some might admit it was a bit frustrating when the AI went off-course, requiring them to wrestle it back. This discussion surfaces the benefits (speed, suggestions, POV shifts) and limitations (quality control, loss of some sense of control) in real terms. It connects back to the earlier analysis: do the experiences align with the notion that AI increases productivity but can reduce sense of ownership? In a workshop setting, participants often feel *more* ownership of the creative protocol than of the exact words, which is a fascinating shift in perspective.

- **“Protocol Fiction: Easy or Hard?”** – Ask them if focusing on a *protocol* in the story was challenging. Did it feel natural or did they have to resist going back to a more typical plot? Which stories made the protocol really integral, and which still felt like they were mainly about people with the protocol as background? This discussion is about the storytelling aspect: how to make an infrastructure interesting. Participants might share tricks they used (e.g., personifying the protocol, or showing its impact through a character’s eyes). If someone managed to depict, say, a **committee meeting as a dramatic scene**, that’s a huge win – it shows bureaucracy/protocol can have narrative tension. This reflection ties to the idea of “bureaucratic heroism” and whether they succeeded in making a protocol the hero or at least a positive force. It’s also fine if some stories ended up showing a protocol fail – that can spark discussion on whether the fiction became a cautionary tale of a bad protocol (which is also a valid outcome, testing against unintended consequences as design fiction often does ([Who could write protocol fiction for speculative infrastructure?](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/08/11/casi#:~:text=Who%20could%20write%20protocol%20fiction,experiment%20form%2C%20against%20unintended))).

- **Ethics and Voice:** Given AI’s involvement, have a short conversation on ethical use. Ensure participants consider crediting AI or acknowledging the method if they publish these works (some publications like Protocolized encourage submitting such stories ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,help%20develop%20this%20nascent%20scene))). Also talk about preserving one’s voice: do they feel the story still sounds like *them*? If anyone feels it doesn’t, what could they do next time to imprint more of their style (perhaps fine-tune the AI with their own writing samples, or do heavier editing)? Share the analogy from Gostev: using AI is like taking a taxi vs driving your own car ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=The%20taxi%20)) ([Writing with AI without losing your soul | Alex Gostev blog | @thegostev](https://thegostev.com/writing-with-ai-without-losing-your-soul/#:~:text=Your%20car%20%28human)) – you want to avoid ending up with a generic journey. How did they ensure their journey was unique?

- **Favorite Tool/Trick Share-out:** Go around and have each participant name one AI prompt or trick that they found useful. This builds a repertoire for everyone. Maybe someone discovered that asking the AI to “rewrite in the style of a folktale” gave their story a cool twist, or someone else used it to generate a fake technical document excerpt to embed in the story for realism. These micro-techniques are extremely valuable takeaways for all involved.

To integrate these ideas into the workshop in an accessible way, provide a **cheat-sheet or handout**. For example, a one-pager with:
- Definition of protocol fiction (belief + desire).
- A few example prompt templates for the exercises (“Yes, and continue…”, “Outline: [template]”, “Interview prompt: …”).
- A list of do’s and don’ts (Do experiment freely; Don’t worry about making it perfect; Do keep your own voice; Don’t let the AI run away on tangents without purpose, etc.).
- Resource list for further reading (maybe links to the articles we summarized, or Protocolized magazine for those who want to read more examples). This anchors the workshop in the broader context and gives newcomers some footing.

### **Example Prompts for Creative Exploration**
To spark imagination, you might give the group a few **story prompt ideas** that exemplify protocol fiction scenarios. For instance:
- *“**The Library of Circuits:** In a near future city, a public library runs an AI-driven protocol that lets citizens trade skills hour-for-hour (teaching someone math earns you an hour of someone teaching you music, etc.). Write a story about a day in the life of a participant, and what happens when someone tries to game the system.”* – This prompt focuses on a cooperation protocol and invites exploration of human motives.
- *“**The Accord of the Rivers:** A global climate treaty isn’t just policy, but an automated smart contract (protocol) that rewards communities for positive environmental data. Describe how a small town’s daily routines change under this regime, and a dramatic incident (like an unintended consequence or a breakthrough success).”* – Here the protocol is almost a character shaping the plot.
- *“**Chatbot Chorus:** In this story, every person is accompanied by a personal AI assistant, and all assistants are networked on a common protocol that mediates social interactions (from scheduling to conflict resolution). Write a scene of two people on a first date with their AI “guardians” negotiating the terms of conversation in the background.”* – A prompt that can produce a mix of humor and insight, and an AI might actually help write the inter AI-dialogue.
- *“**The Last Patch:** A fiction about the final update to a beloved open-source protocol that half the world runs on (imagine something like a decentralized Twitter). The protagonist is one of the protocol’s maintainers. Show the tension between keeping it free vs. pressures to monetize or control it, culminating in a pivotal decision in code.”* – This is a meta-protocol-fiction prompt, likely appealing to those with tech background, and can be written as a series of forum posts, commit messages, and narrative – where AI can help generate the formal texts.

Providing such prompts is optional, as some participants will have their own ideas. But they serve to illustrate the diversity of what protocol fiction can be – it’s not just blockchain or internet protocols, it can be any system of rules (social, legal, technical) that you extrapolate into fiction. Encourage participants to modify prompts or create their own. The key is that the **prompt defines the protocol and the situation**, then the story builds from there.

### **Closing Thoughts for Participants**
Wrap up the workshop by emphasizing that protocol fiction and AI-assisted writing are *frontiers* of storytelling. There are no hard rules (despite the irony that we are making rules in fiction!). The takeaway is a mindset: **be both a writer and a designer**. When writing protocol fiction, you’re designing a hypothetical system and conveying its impact. When writing with AI, you’re designing a process of collaboration. Both require creativity, critical thinking, and heart. 

Encourage participants to continue refining their stories post-workshop and perhaps share them on platforms like *Protocolized*, which is seeking exactly these kinds of experimental pieces ([Haven Tailors - by Sachin and Protocolized - Protocolized](https://protocolized.summerofprotocols.com/p/haven-tailors?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,help%20develop%20this%20nascent%20scene)). Also, invite them to reflect on how these techniques could apply to other genres – for instance, could they use a co-writing protocol when writing a mystery or a historical fiction to similar benefit? The skills learned (prompting, iterative drafting, etc.) are widely applicable.

Finally, acknowledge that we’re in a “brave new world” of writing, but one that has parallels in history. Just as early photographers or filmmakers had to invent the language of their medium, we get to invent how to write stories with intelligent machines. It’s an exciting collaboration between human imagination and artificial generation. As one article optimistically put it, *perhaps the future of literature means having a human at the helm with a computer as co-author* ([Japanese AI Writes a Novel, Nearly Wins Literary Award - Big Think](https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/a-japanese-ai-wrote-a-novel-almost-wins-literary-award/#:~:text=Many%20argue%20that%20while%20these,author)) – not to replace human writers, but to empower them to tell stories that we couldn’t before. 

By the end of the workshop, participants new to protocol fiction should feel they’ve gained a novel way to conceive stories (thinking about systems), and those new to AI writing should feel less intimidated and more curious about using these tools in their creative practice. The structured yet open-ended exercises ensure everyone has a tangible creation to show for their time, and hopefully, they leave inspired to further explore this emerging intersection of **protocols, fiction, and AI**.
