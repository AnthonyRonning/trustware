Insights from Key Sources

Matt Webb on Protocol Fiction (2022)

Matt Webb introduces protocol fiction as a form of design fiction focused on large-scale systems and their rules ?. Instead of centering on individual heroes, protocol fiction imagines new infrastructure ecosystems – for example, a national drone-delivery network or an AI-based health screening system – and writes the protocols (rules and standards) that would allow them to function ?. Webb suggests that writing a fictional protocol can help “unlock the future” by concretely visualizing how diverse actors might coordinate ?. He draws lessons from the origin of the internet: early ARPANET protocols enabled growth by fostering cooperation, expansion, and layering of new protocols ? ?. By analogy, a fictional protocol begins with a “minimum viable network” – a small, working system – and a vision for how it could scale if the incentives and architecture are right ? ?. Webb outlines a bootstrapping process for these imagined systems: (1) envision a well-balanced ecosystem with aligned incentives, (2) draft a protocol (a set of rules, primarily for software) embodying that ecosystem – one that works at a small scale and encourages growth, (3) build a prototype implementation to prove it end-to-end, (4) remove barriers for others to join (e.g. support third parties, address policy hurdles), and (5) iterate as the network expands ?. The protocol spec itself is both a “description of the future” and a proof of the concept’s economics ?. In Webb’s view, the protocol (fictional though it may be) serves as the narrative “where the rubber hits the road,” showing how a future system could actually operate and scale ?. He argues this goes beyond traditional design fiction: it’s not just imagining gadgets or scenarios, but crafting business models, “interop protocol specification fictions,” and even fictitious policy whitepapers – in short, all the coordination mechanisms a real system would need ?. This blend of speculative storytelling and systems design is what Webb calls protocol fiction.

Matt Webb’s Follow-up: Desire and Belief (2023)

In a 2023 follow-up talk/essay, Webb delves deeper into why protocol fiction is valuable, emphasizing the roles of desire and belief ?. He recaps that protocol fiction’s point is to articulate a plausible path to a working reference implementation (to foster belief) and to paint a compelling vision of a better future (to inspire desire) ?. In other words, a good protocol fiction provides a concrete reference model of a new network or system (making it believable) and makes people actually want that future (making it desirable) ?. Webb links this to the challenge of adoption: even a great protocol idea needs narrative to persuade people to invest effort and overcome “stop-energy” (the inertia or skepticism within organizations) ? ?. He cites tech pioneer Dave Winer’s “Rules for standards-makers,” noting that early rules like “Interop is all that matters” and “Working code” build credibility (belief), while later rules about praising developers hint at creating a positive bandwagon effect (desire) ? ?. Webb suggests that beyond the technical design, one must cultivate an almost ideological attraction to the new protocol. Here he invokes Gabriel Tarde’s idea that all social phenomena reduce to belief and desire – forces that motivate imitation and adoption ? ?. Thus, protocol fiction should operate on both fronts: it must convince (showing that the system could work at small scale and then grow) and entice (showing how amazing it would be once it succeeds) ? ?. Webb notes that narrative is an integral part of the design loop: telling a story around the protocol’s success can itself drive its real-world development by rallying support ?. In sum, the 2023 perspective positions protocol fiction as a tool not just for envisioning technology, but for social engineering in a positive sense – generating the will to make the fiction real. “Hence protocol fiction,” Webb writes, tying together the need for imaginative storytelling with the practical steps of building new, cooperative infrastructure ?.

Protocolized Newsletter: Chiang’s Law and “Strange New Rules”

The Protocolized newsletter launch (by Venkatesh Rao et al.) frames protocol fiction with what it calls Chiang’s Law: “science fiction is about strange rules, while fantasy is about special people.” ? This dictum – attributed to sci-fi author Ted Chiang – is the guiding “north star” for the protocol fiction initiative ?. It encapsulates the ethos that interesting rules and systems should drive stories, rather than Chosen One protagonists. In Chiang’s view, science fiction is the literature of change and exploration of mechanisms, whereas fantasy centers on personal destiny and immutable ideals ?. If a story’s protagonist deals with rules (even bizarre, novel rules that apply universally in that world), it’s sci-fi; if the story hinges on a protagonist’s unique specialness, it’s fantasy ?. The newsletter argues this lens is revealing: many modern tech narratives that seem like sci-fi are actually fantasy in disguise – for example, Silicon Valley’s habit of mythologizing “Great Men” and 10x engineers echoes fantasy hero tropes more than systemic thinking ? ?. True science fiction, by Chiang’s Law, treats no person as above the system; it’s about how strange new systems (often technological or social) affect everyone equally ?. Protocol fiction naturally aligns with Chiang’s Law: it foregrounds the rules of the future – the protocols – as the key drivers of the narrative outcome, rather than any singular hero. The Strange New Rules issue of the newsletter explicitly aims to build a “brave new genre of protocol fiction” and to do for protocols what Astounding magazine did for early sci-fi ?. It introduces resources like a Protocol Reader (with dozens of essays and a couple of fiction pieces) to kickstart “protocol literacy” and inspire more writers to tell these stories ?. In short, this source positions protocol fiction as a cultural movement, using Chiang’s Law to champion system-focused storytelling in an age that often prefers hero-centric narratives. The emphasis is on imagining worlds where the protocols themselves are the protagonists, shaping societies in unexpected ways.

César Aira – “The New Writing” (Essay, 2013)

Argentine writer César Aira’s essay “The New Writing” provides a philosophical backdrop on innovation in literature that resonates with protocol fiction and AI-assisted writing. Aira observes that after centuries of development, the traditional forms of art (like the classic 19th-century novel) risk becoming stagnant, mere “professional” productions imitating old models ?. The 20th-century avant-garde responded by shifting focus from works to procedures: “the great artists of the twentieth century are not those who created works, but those who created procedures through which works could be made” ?. Techniques like automatic writing, the ready-made, cut-up writing, chance operations, and algorithmic composition were all ways to inject new life by inventing new rules and processes ?. In this view, the process itself becomes the art – “putting processes back on the throne which had been occupied until then by results” ?. Aira suggests that if art is in danger of ossifying, one solution is to reinvent the act of creation through playful or experimental protocols (even if they seem “irresponsible or barbarous” to traditionalists) ? ?. Crucially, this means art can be “made by all” – liberated from the cult of genius – because the focus shifts to following a procedure or system, rather than relying on personal inspiration alone ? ?. The “work” might just be a byproduct or documentation of the creative process, which is the real artistic achievement ?. This essay’s insights connect to writing with LLMs and protocol fiction in two ways. First, protocol fiction’s emphasis on rules is an extension of the avant-garde idea that new writing procedures can yield new kinds of stories. Instead of writing another conventional hero’s journey, an author might devise a procedure (or protocol) – for example, a constraint or a fictional rule set – and let that generate the narrative. Second, using AI as a writing partner can itself be seen as a new procedure. Aira celebrates artists who create via “indeterminacy” and “chance” operations ?, which is echoed when a writer uses an AI’s output (which has an element of unpredictability) as part of the creative process. Finally, Aira’s disdain for over-professionalized art suggests we should approach AI co-writing and protocol fiction in an experimental, open spirit rather than a perfectionist one. He notes that originally the artist was “a non-specialist, and an amateur” and that perhaps art is returning to that state ?. This sentiment foreshadows the idea from the workshops (below) that overemphasizing professionalism can “kill” creativity. In summary, Aira’s New Writing argues that innovation comes from new methods of writing – a principle that underlies both the concept of protocol fiction (new narrative rules) and the practice of writing with LLMs as a generative tool.

“LLM Friendly Zone” – Experiments in Writing with AI

In the Summer Lightning newsletter (by Sachin Benny, a Summer of Protocols researcher), the author describes his recent experiments in making his writing process an “LLM friendly zone.” While the full text isn’t quoted here, the context suggests he is exploring how to effectively collaborate with Large Language Models in creative writing. This likely involves setting up conditions or styles of writing that play to an LLM’s strengths. For example, an LLM-friendly writing process might include breaking the narrative into smaller, promptable chunks, providing structured inputs (like outlines or explicit rules) that the model can follow, or adjusting one’s prose style to be clear and context-rich so the AI can continue it sensibly. Sachin’s interest in protocol fiction (his project features a character whose catchphrase is “It’s just protocol” ?) implies that he’s trying to write fiction where the structure (protocol) is central, using AI as a collaborator. In practical terms, an LLM Friendly Zone could mean treating the AI as a co-author that excels at certain tasks: world-building details, brainstorming protocol ideas, or generating dialogue that fits a rule-driven world. The write-up likely shares insights on prompt strategies, such as using role prompts (“You are a speculative fiction writer imagining a new protocol…”) or iterative refinement of AI outputs. It probably also addresses challenges (the AI drifting off-protocol or introducing clichés) and how to steer it back – essentially, how to “prime” the LLM with enough context and constraints so that its contributions remain on-theme (in this case, focused on the systems and rules of the fiction, not just random plot). The overarching takeaway is that writing with LLMs may require a certain mindset and environment: instead of treating the AI as a threat or a gimmick, treat it as a creative partner within a sandbox of well-defined rules – a zone where both human and AI understand the protocol of how the story is being built.

Workshop Summary: “Professionalization is the Mind-Killer”

The first protocol fiction workshop (as summarized in Summer Lightning) carried the provocative lesson that “professionalization is the mind-killer.” This phrase (a play on the Dune quote “fear is the mind-killer”) encapsulates the idea that being overly concerned with professional writing standards and polished outcomes can stifle the experimental, innovative spirit needed for protocol fiction. In the workshop, writers likely came from diverse backgrounds (tech, policy, fiction, etc.), and a key encouragement was to embrace the amateur mindset. This doesn’t mean producing poor quality work, but rather giving oneself permission to play, iterate, and even fail without the pressure of perfection. Such an environment is crucial when exploring unorthodox formats like protocol fiction or co-writing with AI. The summary probably noted that many great ideas surfaced when writers set aside their “is this publishable?” filter and instead followed their curiosity – much as Aira argued that innovation comes from those willing to be playful or even “irresponsible” in method ?. By avoiding premature professional rigor (e.g. strict adherence to traditional story structure or polished prose from the get-go), participants were able to draft unusual narratives: fictional memos, dialogues between protocols, rulebooks as stories, etc. The mantra “professionalization kills the creative mind” aligns with Aira’s point that art should be open to everyone and not only the domain of polished experts ? ?. For writers using LLMs, this insight is double-edged: On one hand, an LLM can produce very formal, “professional”-sounding text on demand, but relying on that too early could lead to bland or derivative results. The workshop likely encouraged explorative prompting and rough drafts, using the AI to generate wild ideas or atypical formats first, and only later shaping them into something more refined. In essence, the workshop’s key takeaway is that mindset matters: treat protocol fiction as a playground for new ideas at the intersection of technology and narrative, and don’t let conventional standards or the inner editor scare you away from bizarre or novel concepts. Professional polish can come later; in the early stages, staying open, experimental, and even a bit unprofessional can lead to genuinely original fiction.

Additional Perspectives on Protocol Fiction and AI Writing

Beyond the provided sources, further research shows that protocol fiction fits into a broader trend of system-centric storytelling in contemporary literature. The New York Times recently identified a subgenre called the “apocalyptic systems thriller” (AST) – multi-stranded novels that take a panoramic view of global events, treating diverse situations as interconnected parts of a larger system ?. These stories (e.g. geopolitical technothrillers about climate collapse or pandemics) often read like scenario planning exercises for society. They induce “a kind of sublime awe at the complexity of the global networks in which we’re enmeshed,” as one commentator describes ?. In an AST, no single hero can grasp or solve the crisis; instead, the narrative jumps between many nodes, emphasizing interdependence and often using the aesthetic of logs, data, and acronyms to convey an underlying order ? ?. This is closely aligned with what protocol fiction seeks to do (indeed, the Summer of Protocols community has noted that ASTs are essentially a subset of protocol fiction ? ?). For example, Kim Stanley Robinson’s The Ministry for the Future – a novel structured around a UN agency’s multifaceted efforts to address climate change – reads like a compilation of policy protocols, disaster responses, and economic measures, rather than a single-thread narrative. It illustrates how fiction can serve as a testbed for new protocols: different methods to refreeze the poles, new crypto-carbon currencies, geoengineering accords, etc., all are explored in story form to examine their impacts. Classic science fiction also offers precedents. Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series can be seen as early protocol fiction: Hari Seldon’s psychohistory is essentially a protocol (a scientific-social plan) to save civilization, and the drama derives from how that plan unfolds and adapts over centuries. As one analysis notes, Foundation was about planners trying to shorten a coming dark age – much like modern system novels try to prepare us for or prevent catastrophes by imagining the right systems in advance ?. The difference is that today’s protocol fiction often has a more open-source ethos: instead of a secret plan by one genius, it’s about collaborative protocols anyone can implement or join.

Additionally, the design fiction community provides tools that overlap with protocol fiction. Design fiction involves creating artifacts from the future – prototypes, product brochures, user manuals – to explore how new technology might change society. Protocol fiction can be seen as a sibling to this practice, but focusing on standards and agreements rather than gadgets. Instead of a mock-up of a future smartphone, a protocol fiction writer might write a mock RFC (Request for Comments) detailing a future communication standard, or a snippet of a future governance document (like fictional legislation or terms of service) around which a narrative is built. By treating these documents as story elements, the fiction gains a sense of concrete realism. This was exemplified by author Robin Sloan’s Spring ’83 experiment: he published a narrative specification for a new decentralized social media protocol (essentially a story in the form of a tech spec), complete with limitations and affordances for users ?. The result was not only an engaging read, but also actionable – readers got involved and built early implementations of the protocol ?. This blurring of fiction and reality (where a fictional protocol inspires real prototypes) is a unique power of the genre. It echoes Webb’s insight that a good protocol fiction can make funding a prototype seem “straightforward” by clearly communicating costs and benefits ?.

From the perspective of writing with AI, protocol fiction presents an attractive domain. LLMs excel at producing structured text and can simulate formal documents or dialogues between stakeholders, which are often components of protocol fiction. Research into human-AI co-writing suggests that giving AI specific roles or constraints can lead to more useful output. For instance, one might assign the LLM the role of a “standards committee scribe” and ask it to draft meeting minutes from a future standards body discussing the protocol. This leverages the AI’s strength in mimicking factual and technical tone. Another approach is using the AI to expand world-building: given the rule-set of a fictional world, the AI can generate vignettes of how different people or places operate under those rules, providing raw material that a human writer can curate. However, additional research cautions about the limitations of LLMs in this arena: they can be too generic if not guided well, and may unintentionally introduce inconsistencies. Maintaining a strict “bible” of the fictional protocol (a set of canonical rules) and feeding that into the prompt can mitigate hallucinations and keep the AI on track. In essence, the emerging consensus is that AI is best used as a specialized tool or brainstorming partner in fiction, rather than a fully autonomous storyteller. When writing about protocols – which demand consistency and logical outcomes – the human writer often must act as an editor and systems-engineer, verifying that the AI-generated ideas actually fit the established rule framework. This aligns with the collaborative, procedural spirit that César Aira championed: treating the writing process itself as a kind of experiment or game, in which the AI is a participant following (or sometimes bending) the rules set forth by the writer.

Key Takeaways and Implications for Writing with LLMs

Bringing together the above insights, several important themes emerge at the intersection of protocol fiction and AI-assisted writing:
	•	Storytelling as Systems Design: Protocol fiction reframes storytelling as the design of a system of interactions. Instead of focusing on character arcs alone, the writer designs how various entities (people, organizations, algorithms) interact according to certain rules or protocols. This approach is inherently suited to collaboration with LLMs. An AI can help enumerate possibilities within a rule set or simulate the behavior of agents following the protocol. The writer, in turn, curates and gives narrative shape to these simulations. The implication is that writing becomes more like running an experiment – you define initial conditions (the protocol) and let the story emerge from them. This is a new paradigm of creativity where human and machine can iterate together on rule-driven narratives.
	•	Belief, Desire, and Persuasion in Fiction: A key takeaway from Webb and the Chiang’s Law perspective is that a successful speculative story must generate belief in its plausibility and desire for its vision ?. For writers using LLMs, this is a reminder that factual detail and compelling description are both needed. LLMs can be very useful in fleshing out factual minutiae or consistent rules (building belief through internal consistency and realistic detail). They can also help amplify the sense of wonder or urgency (tapping into desire) by, say, describing the beauty of a world running on the new protocol or the horror of life before it. The writer should guide the AI in alternating between these modes – technical exposition to ground the story and vivid imagination to excite the reader. Moreover, because protocol fiction often aims to convince readers (and perhaps real-world stakeholders) that a certain future is worth pursuing, the collaboration with AI can be used to iterate on rhetoric. For example, one might prompt the AI to generate a passionate speech by a character about why the new system is necessary, and elsewhere generate a skeptical critique – using both to enrich the narrative with a dialogue of ideas. In short, the implication for LLM-assisted writing is to consciously craft the emotional arc (desire) as carefully as the logical arc (belief), something a human-AI team can do by playing to each other’s strengths (AI generating variations, human selecting those that resonate).
	•	Embracing New Procedures and Breaking Tradition: Both Aira’s essay and the workshop mantra underscore the value of experimental process. For writers, this means letting go of the fear of doing it “wrong.” When using LLMs, traditionalists might balk at the idea of machine-generated text, but protocol fiction’s ethos suggests every tool is fair game if it yields fresh ideas. The implication is to treat the LLM as a brainstorming tool without the stigma – akin to surrealists using automatic writing or Brian Eno using generative music cards. One practical application is to use the AI for structured randomness: ask it to introduce a random new rule or anomaly in the protocol and see how that could play out. This can produce plot twists or conflict that a human might not have considered, but still within the realm of “what happens if the rules change in this way.” By iterating like this, the story can explore multiple facets of the protocol’s impact. The caution, however, is that not every AI suggestion will make sense; the human must remain the arbiter of coherence and meaning, stitching together the best outcomes of these procedural experiments. This approach reinforces the idea that writing with LLMs can be a bit like game mastering – setting up scenarios and letting the AI (as a pseudo-player) contribute moves, then adjusting the scenario accordingly.
	•	Democratization of Writing and Multi-disciplinary Collaboration: Protocol fiction often requires knowledge of technology, sociology, economics, etc., and the workshops brought together people from different fields. One implication is that writing with AI can lower some barriers for non-professional writers to engage in such complex storytelling. An entrepreneur or engineer who isn’t a polished writer could use an LLM to help articulate a fictional scenario about their domain – the AI can draft narrative text from the user’s outline of ideas. This fulfills Aira’s vision of art made by amateurs and non-specialists ?. Conversely, a fiction writer without a tech background could use AI to simulate technical details more convincingly. In both cases, the LLM acts as a bridge across domains of expertise. The takeaway is a potentially more inclusive form of storytelling, where what matters is the idea for a protocol and its implications, not one’s prose prowess. That said, it also implies a new skill for writers: prompt engineering and fact-checking the AI. The writer becomes a curator of content – the one who knows enough of each domain to verify the AI’s output and ensure it aligns with the story’s needs. This multidisciplinary juggling is itself akin to being a “protocol designer,” balancing inputs from different realms.
	•	Potential for Real-World Impact: An exciting implication of protocol fiction (especially when amplified by widely accessible AI tools) is that it can serve as a form of open-source futurism. Just as Robin Sloan’s fictional protocol sparked real experiments ?, a compelling protocol fiction circulated widely could inspire communities or startups to pursue similar projects in reality. LLMs could help generate not just stories but also supportive materials – for instance, alongside a story you might use the AI to produce a mock press release, FAQ, or technical spec of the fictional protocol and publish those as a package. This blurs the line between fiction and proposal. While ethically the author should clarify what is fiction, the technique can engage readers in a deeper way, letting them imagine themselves inside the world via these artifacts. It’s a kind of ARG (Alternate Reality Game) approach to literature. The implication is that writers (with AI assistance) might become facilitators of social prototypes, not just storytellers. Especially with generative tools to handle the grunt work of documentation, a lone writer could produce a fairly comprehensive “future scenario kit.” This has implications for how society does planning: fiction might become an accepted part of policy brainstorming, and AI can help churn out scenario variations at scale.

In summary, the fusion of protocol fiction and LLM-based writing practices suggests a future of storytelling that is highly procedural, collaborative, and impactful beyond entertainment. Writers will need to think like designers and facilitators, and AI will be a creative collaborator that operates within human-defined constraints. The stories produced in this way could not only entertain, but also educate and even directly inspire real changes – making fiction a step in the protocol-development pipeline for the real world.

Strategies for Writing Protocol Fiction

Crafting protocol fiction requires a different approach from conventional fiction. Here are several actionable strategies and narrative techniques unique to this genre:
	•	1. World-Build from the Rulebook Outwards: Begin by explicitly defining the core protocol or rule-set that governs your fictional world. This could be a new economic system, a communication standard, a set of laws, or an algorithm that society abides by. Write it down almost like a spec – what are the rules, who implements/enforces them, and what outcomes are they supposed to produce? This document can serve as your North Star. All world-building then stems from this: consider how every aspect of life (commerce, relationships, politics, etc.) is affected by the protocol’s introduction. By solidifying the rules, you ensure internal consistency and give your story a center of gravity around which characters and conflicts will form ? ? (the protocol itself acts like an unseen “character” with agency). As an exercise, you might actually include excerpts of this fictional rulebook or standard within the story – for example, start chapters with brief quotes from the protocol’s text or its user manual, to continually remind readers of the framework.
	•	2. Show the Creation and Adoption of the Protocol: A rich narrative approach is to dramatize the process of how the protocol comes to be and spreads. This often involves multiple perspectives:
	•	The Designers: Characters who draft the protocol (engineers, policymakers, visionaries) – through their eyes we see the intentions behind it. You can write scenes of brainstorming sessions, heated debates over clauses, or test deployments. This is where belief is built – show their logic and hopes ?.
	•	The Early Adopters: Characters who first implement or encounter the protocol. Perhaps a small community that uses the new system and benefits from it, illustrating the desire – what’s compelling about it ?. Here you can include testimonials, day-in-the-life vignettes, or even news reports (fictional) about initial successes.
	•	The Skeptics/Opponents: Characters who resist or misuse the protocol. Their stories can surface the cracks – maybe unintended consequences or fears (e.g., “is this just a fantasy of control by elites?” echoing Chiang’s Law about Great Men vs rules ?). By giving them a voice, you create tension and force the proponents to address challenges.
	•	The Broader Society: As time skips ahead in the story, show the protocol reaching a tipping point. Perhaps intersperse world-building interludes like fake Wikipedia entries, forum discussions, or historical retrospectives about how the protocol changed things. This multi-strand approach is effective for protocol fiction; it mirrors the AST style of narrative that hops across a system ?. It also helps avoid focusing on a single “hero” and instead paints a collective portrait of change.
	•	3. Use Mixed Media Storytelling: Protocol fiction lends itself to an epistolary or dossier format – a collection of documents that together tell a story. Consider incorporating elements like:
	•	Memos or emails between key players negotiating the protocol (“Memo from the Standards Committee, 2030-07-15”).
	•	Excerpts from the protocol specification or terms of service ?.
	•	News articles or press releases announcing milestones (“Global Drone Network Launched under OpenSky Protocol”).
	•	Personal diary entries or interviews from people living under the new system.
	•	Technical incident reports or customer support chats showing problems that arose.
This mosaic approach not only keeps readers engaged with variety, but each artifact can reveal a different facet of the world. For example, a technical spec excerpt reveals the constraints of the system, while an interview reveals the human impact. When arranged cleverly, the reader pieces together the narrative much like understanding a complex system through its logs and outputs. Authors like John Brunner (Stand on Zanzibar) and Max Brooks (World War Z) have used similar techniques to depict system-wide phenomena via collated texts. In protocol fiction, this method reinforces the theme that no single viewpoint can encompass the whole system – you need many small windows to see it all ?.
	•	4. Focus on Consequences and Feedback Loops: Every protocol is created for a purpose, but in a story you should explore whether it actually achieves that purpose – and what side effects it has. Map out the intended vs. actual outcomes of the protocol in your plot:
	•	Identify a problem the protocol is meant to solve (e.g. information overload, climate crisis coordination, financial exclusion).
	•	Show how the protocol addresses it, at least in a pilot scenario (e.g. a successful reduction of fake news due to a truth-rating protocol).
	•	Then introduce a twist: how does human nature or complexity foil the ideal outcome? Perhaps people find loopholes in the rules, or a power bloc co-opts the system for a different agenda. For instance, a protocol meant to democratize something might inadvertently create a new elite class of those who maintain the protocol (a scenario not unlike Orwell’s pigs in Animal Farm bending the rules – except here the rules themselves are the battleground).
	•	Depict the protocol’s evolution in response. Maybe a version 2.0 of the protocol is proposed in-story to fix issues, leading to conflict between “conservatives” who like version 1.0 and “reformers.” This can mirror real-world processes of standardization (like competing protocol drafts). It also adds drama to something abstract – essentially treating a protocol update like a pivotal plot event.
By focusing on cause and effect, you ensure the story remains about the protocol. Every chapter can be structured as a stage in the life of the system: conception, initial effects, wider adoption, first failures, adaptation, and so on. This inherently provides narrative drive (will the system survive or collapse under pressures?) and also intellectual satisfaction as the reader sees a simulation of social dynamics. It helps to borrow tools from futures studies: think in terms of scenarios and what-if experiments, which fiction is great at delivering.
	•	5. Leverage Metaphor and Human Stories to Avoid Dryness: One risk of protocol fiction is that it can become too abstract or technical. To keep it engaging, embed metaphors and human-scale stories that symbolize the bigger picture. For example, you might have a recurring personal storyline: say, a relationship between two characters that is impacted by the protocol. In a world governed by a matchmaking algorithm, a couple might struggle against an incompatibility score. Their journey provides a relatable emotional arc while you explore the larger question of algorithmic authority. Another example: if your protocol is about resource-sharing between cities, perhaps follow a truck driver (or a drone operator) who actually implements those rules daily – through their eyes, the rules become tangible (routes, checkpoints, etc.) rather than just concepts. Metaphor can be powerful too: Ted Chiang often uses intimate narratives to explicate big ideas. In your story, if the protocol is essentially about communication, you might mirror that theme in how characters communicate (or fail to). Maybe a subplot involves two estranged siblings whose reconciliation parallels society’s coming together via the new protocol. These human elements keep readers invested and provide analogy for the protocol’s effect on society at large (“If it can reunite these two, maybe it can unify the world…”). Always ask, “Who experiences this aspect of the protocol, and how can I show it through their eyes?” This ensures the story never feels like a white paper, even as it delivers the speculative insight.
	•	6. Incorporate Visual Aids or Diagrams (if medium allows): Because protocols are structural, sometimes a diagram or chart can actually be worth a thousand words in your story. Don’t shy away from embedding a simple network diagram, a timeline of key events, or a flowchart of how the protocol works (perhaps drawn as if by a character in-universe). This not only adds realism (it’s plausible that a report or article in the story would include a chart), but also helps readers cognitively map the system. For instance, a diagram of a network topology might accompany a scene about decentralizing the internet, or a before-and-after chart might show metrics that changed due to the protocol (e.g. a graph of carbon emissions dropping after a climate protocol implementation). These can serve as narrative beats (the reveal of the chart can be a dramatic moment of “it’s working!” or “it’s failing!”). While this strategy is optional, it recognizes that protocol fiction sits at an intersection of literature and design – borrowing communication techniques from technical fields can enhance the storytelling. At the very least, thinking visually during your writing process (sketching these for yourself) can clarify how you describe complex interactions in prose.

By applying these strategies, a writer can construct a protocol fiction that is immersive and thought-provoking. The goal is to make the protocol come alive as the central element of the story – effectively turning a dry set of rules into a living, breathing narrative force. Each strategy above ensures that readers see the protocol from various angles: its text, its creators, its users, its consequences, and its symbolism in human terms. This multi-dimensional approach is what gives protocol fiction its richness, marrying the technical with the personal.

Examples of Protocol Fiction in Practice

Protocol fiction is still an emerging category, but several works (old and new) exemplify its principles. These examples, written by human authors (not AI-generated), showcase how focusing on “strange rules” can yield compelling narratives:
	•	Robin Sloan’s “Spring ’83” – A Narrative Protocol Specification:  Technologist-writer Robin Sloan created a fictional protocol called Spring ’83, intended as a new way to share information online. Instead of a traditional story, Sloan wrote a narrative specification, describing how the protocol works (e.g. sharing “boards” of text/HTML limited to 2217 bytes, no scripts) and the philosophy behind it ?. The piece reads like a tech document but with an imaginative tone, inviting readers to envision a kinder, decentralized social web. Not only did this fiction articulate the rules of a novel network, it actually spurred reality: Sloan published a draft spec on GitHub, and readers began building implementations ?. In effect, the fiction became a prototype. Spring ’83 illustrates protocol fiction beautifully – the protagonist is essentially the protocol design itself, and the narrative is an experiment in what kinds of interactions that protocol would allow or prevent. By the end, readers are left not with a moral, but with a blueprint and a question: “Would you like to try this new system?” It’s both story and invitation.
	•	Malka Older’s Infomocracy – Micro-democracy Thriller: This 2016 novel is a political sci-fi thriller built around a new global governance system. The premise: nation-states are replaced by “centenals” (100,000-person districts) that can each choose their own government, enabled by a worldwide information bureaucracy called Information that ensures fair elections and factual news ?. In essence, Older invented a political protocol for democracy – a meticulous set of rules about how elections are run and how information flows. The story then follows characters working for (and against) this system during a pivotal election. Infomocracy is filled with protocol fiction elements: there are debates over implementation, insurgent groups trying to hack the system, and ordinary citizens navigating a world where your neighbor might be under a different government than you. The narrative asks, “How would society change if democracy were networked like this?” By focusing on Information – the UN/Google-esque organization that administrates the rules – the novel keeps the system itself at the forefront. Reviewers noted it sits at “the intersection of policy wonk and science fiction geek” ?. It’s a prime example of how to turn an abstract governance model into a gripping story, complete with chase scenes and conspiracies, without ever losing sight of the micro-democracy protocol that drives the plot.
	•	Daniel Suarez’s Daemon (and sequel Freedom™) – A Distributed Algorithm as Antagonist: Daemon (2006) is a techno-thriller in which a genius game developer, upon his death, unleashes a self-sustaining software daemon across the internet. This daemon (a background process) orchestrates a series of events via a network of hacked systems and recruited humans, essentially attempting to install a new world order according to the dead developer’s vision. The daemon’s rules for society borrow from multiplayer gaming: people gain levels and titles by performing tasks for the system, and those who oppose it are eliminated. In one scene, a character explains, “the Daemon is a remorseless system for building a distributed civilization… one with no central authority” ?. This is protocol fiction in the mode of a thriller – the “protocol” is an AI’s code that readers see gradually taking over, and the conflict is fundamentally about centralized authority vs. decentralized, algorithmic rule. The sequel Freedom™ explores the burgeoning society that operates on the Daemon’s principles, with even agriculture and justice mediated by its software. What makes this an example of protocol fiction is how much attention is given to the mechanics of the daemon’s system – it’s not magic; it’s presented as a plausible (if extreme) network of programs and incentives. Suarez invites us to consider both the appeal and danger of an incorruptible rule-based order. The Daemon has no face – it’s pure protocol, and yet it serves as a formidable character shaping the narrative. These novels straddle sci-fi and thriller, but at their core is a speculative protocol that tests what a society without traditional governments might look like, earning them status as early popular examples of this idea space.
	•	Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series – Galactic Future History via Psychohistory: While not described in these terms originally (the first book dates to 1951), Foundation can be retroactively seen as proto–protocol fiction. Hari Seldon’s science of psychohistory is essentially a set of mathematical rules governing societal behavior. He establishes the Foundation with an Encyclopedia project as a ruse, while really it’s following a plan (the Seldon Plan) to rebuild civilization after the Galactic Empire’s fall, guided by psychohistorical calculations (a “protocol” for societal progression). Throughout the series, particularly the original trilogy, the focus is less on individual heroics and more on whether societies stay on track with the Plan or deviate. At set intervals, holographic messages from Seldon update everyone on the protocol’s expectations, almost like a program releasing patches. Although characters like Salvor Hardin and Bayta Darell are important, they often succeed by aligning with the Plan’s imperatives rather than sheer personal specialness – reinforcing Chiang’s Law perspective ?. Notably, when a true anomaly (the Mule, a mutant with mind-control powers) arises, it’s a crisis because he breaks the protocol (psychohistory couldn’t predict him). The series thereby dramatizes a tension between deterministic rules and human unpredictability, a hallmark of protocol fiction. As one modern reflection put it, the genre tries to do what psychohistorians did: provide a playbook for navigating systemic collapse ?. Foundation remains a touchstone because it showed that you can build narrative stakes around the fate of a system (the future galactic civilization) rather than one person. The recent TV adaptation even leans into this, visually emphasizing the Vault and Seldon’s program as a character in its own right.
	•	Kim Stanley Robinson’s The Ministry for the Future – Policy as Narrative: This 2020 novel is essentially a fictional documentary about the world’s attempt to avert climate catastrophe through a myriad of protocols – from a carbon coin cryptocurrency to geoengineering accords and radical eco-activism cells. The titular Ministry is an international body created by the Paris Agreement, and through its work, the novel explores dozens of intertwined initiatives. Rather than a single storyline, it reads as dispatches from the future of policy, featuring meeting notes, eyewitness accounts, and even primer-style explanations of climate science. This aligns with the AST (Apocalyptic Systems Thriller) mode ?. The narrative impact comes from seeing the systemic response to a crisis: how central banks, insurance schemes, and social movements all act as pieces of a global puzzle. Robinson’s work exemplifies how protocol fiction can tackle real-world issues – it’s a thought experiment in global governance protocols. While it can be dense, many readers felt it was like reading a future history that doubles as a manual. It’s protocol fiction in that it’s less about any one person (characters are vessels to show facets of the effort) and more about coordinated action through agreed rules. For instance, a significant “character” is the carbon coin idea itself, which is introduced, tested, and eventually widely adopted, changing the global economy – essentially the life story of a protocol. Robinson’s novel shows the potential of the genre to cross into a form of advocacy or simulation, influencing how people think about real protocols like those discussed in climate policy circles.

Other notable mentions include Bruce Sterling’s Distraction (1998), a near-future satire about American politics where the plot centers on a data-driven campaign and an autonomous “Republic” in a chaotic USA – effectively exploring what happens when new political protocols arise amid collapse. Sterling’s work, alongside his concept of “design fiction,” laid groundwork for thinking about political and technical systems in SF. Additionally, experimental writers like those in the Oulipo movement (e.g. Georges Perec) wrote entire novels with strict constraints (like avoiding a letter), which is a more formalist kind of protocol fiction – demonstrating that rules themselves can generate literary intrigue. These examples collectively show that while the term “protocol fiction” is new, the practice of storytelling about systems and rules has rich precedents. What’s changing now is a growing self-awareness and community around this approach, especially as our lives are increasingly governed by literal protocols (internet standards, smart contracts, etc.).

Each of the above works illustrates how focusing on strange new rules can produce engaging stories that double as thought experiments. Whether it’s a communications protocol, a governance system, an algorithmic directive, or a scientific plan, these fictions put the protocol at the heart of the drama – validating the idea that rules and systems can indeed be as engrossing as heroes and monsters.

Prompting Techniques for Protocol Fiction with LLMs

When using Large Language Models to assist in writing protocol fiction, crafting the right prompts is crucial. Here are some techniques and prompt strategies to get the most out of an LLM while keeping it focused on protocol-driven storytelling:
	•	1. Clearly Define the Protocol in the Prompt: LLMs respond well to concrete information. Begin your interaction by feeding the model the rule-set or premise of your fictional protocol. For example: “Here is the premise of the world: All citizens are scored by an AI social credit protocol that determines their access to services. The rules of this protocol are as follows: [list rules]. Write a scene where….” By providing this upfront, you anchor the AI’s responses in the framework of your choosing. The model will be less likely to wander off into unrelated territory because you’ve given it a clear context. Essentially, you are establishing the “canon” before asking for narrative. You can even paste in short excerpts of the fictional spec (perhaps bullet-pointed rules) and then say “Given the above protocol, generate X…”. This ensures consistency and saves time correcting the model’s false assumptions about your world.
	•	2. Use Role Prompting and Perspectives: To get varied and rich content, ask the LLM to adopt specific roles or perspectives within the story’s context ?. For instance:
	•	“You are a journalist in the year 2040 writing an article about the rollout of [Protocol X]. Interview a citizen and a government official about how it’s going.”
	•	“Imagine you’re the lead engineer who designed [Protocol X]. Explain in a monologue your motivation and the challenges you faced, as if speaking at a press conference.”
	•	“Take on the role of an opposition leader who believes [Protocol X] is dangerous. Write a speech outlining their concerns.”
Persona-based prompting guides the style, tone, and content of the AI’s output towards specific facets of your narrative ?. This is useful for generating dialogue and conflicting viewpoints, which you can then incorporate into your story. By cycling through roles (engineer, user, skeptic, etc.), you effectively simulate that multi-perspective approach without having to come up with all sides yourself. It’s like having a virtual writer’s room where each AI persona contributes according to a defined mindset.
	•	3. Iterate with Constraint and Refinement Prompts: Treat the LLM as a collaborator that you can refine. Start with a broad prompt to get raw ideas, then zero in. For example:
	1.	Brainstorm prompt: “List five possible unintended consequences of [Protocol X] affecting everyday life.” (This might yield a list of interesting scenarios.)
	2.	Pick one and expand: “Great, consequence #3 (where AI traffic protocol causes all stoplights to turn green and chaos ensues) – write a short story or scene about that event from a pedestrian’s point of view.”
	3.	Refine style: If the result is too dry or too chaotic, you can add constraints: “Rewrite that scene in a more suspenseful tone, and include the internal thoughts of the pedestrian as they realize something is wrong with the traffic system.”
By iterating, you guide the model to produce exactly what you need. Use the model’s own output as input for the next prompt (a technique sometimes called chain-of-thought prompting when you ask the model to reason step by step). For example, if continuity is an issue, you can prompt: “Given the following outline of story events [X], [Y], [Z] that happened so far, continue the story to show the next step in the protocol’s evolution.” This keeps the AI aware of prior context. The key is to not settle for the first output – treat each output as a draft that can be clarified or improved with a follow-up prompt.
	•	4. Incorporate In-Prompt Examples (Few-Shot Prompting): LLMs can learn the pattern or style you want if you show them an example. If you’ve written a short passage yourself that captures the vibe, include it. For instance: “Here is an example of the style of narrative I want, focusing on the protocol: [Excerpt]. Now, write the next chapter in a similar style, dealing with [Protocol aspect].” The model will imitate the style and structure of your example ?. You can also show format examples: if you want a dialogue transcript format, first prompt with a mini-dialogue as format guide. Or if mixing document styles (memo, article), show a short fake memo and then ask for a new memo on another topic. This technique, known as few-shot learning, helps the AI pick up context cues and maintain consistency across different sections.
	•	5. Ask the LLM to Generate Supporting Artifacts: Beyond narrative prose, use the AI to produce the ephemera of your world, which you can integrate for realism. Some prompt ideas:
	•	“Write a snippet of the user manual for [Protocol X] explaining how a new user registers, in a neutral instructional tone.”
	•	“Generate a fake chat log between two users who just started using [Protocol X], showing their confusion and discovery.”
	•	“Produce a brief news report (with headline and byline) about the failure of [Protocol X] in one city, citing an official spokesperson.”
These pieces can either be directly included in your story (epistolary style) or serve as background material for you to write around. They also help you, as the writer, understand your own world better. Sometimes the AI might point out a scenario you hadn’t thought of (“User A: I tried to cheat the system and got banned.”) – which you can decide to incorporate or not. By prompting for specific artifact types, you ensure the AI stays on topic (it’s easier for it to mimic a specific format than to “freestyle” entirely). This technique essentially outsources some world-building grunt work to the AI, leaving you free to focus on the main narrative.
	•	6. Balance Guidance with Creativity – the Art of the Nudge: LLMs can produce very straightforward continuations or wildly off-course tangents depending on how you prompt. To keep a protocol fiction story coherent, you want to nudge the AI firmly, but not strangle its creativity. A good practice is to prefix prompts with context reminders or rules. For example: “Reminder: In this world, magic does not exist and the tone is realistic and technical. The protocol is always mentioned by name (’CivicNet’). Now, write a dialogue….” This re-establishes boundaries every time. However, also allow the AI some freedom in how it meets your request. If you over-specify (“include exactly these three points in exactly this way”), you might as well write it yourself – and the text could become stilted. Instead, try prompts that are open-ended within constraints: “Write a dramatic confrontation between the protocol’s founder and a regulator who wants to shut it down. Convey both viewpoints strongly. End the scene with an uncertain resolution.” Here you defined the scenario and the goal, but not each line – the AI has room to invent the dialogue, maybe surprising you. Often, the best outputs come when the AI is given a clear role and scenario but then allowed to riff. You can always edit or polish afterwards. Think of prompting like giving stage directions to an improv actor: set the scene, define the characters, mention the conflict, and let the actor (the AI) perform. If the performance goes astray, you interject as the director with clarifications and have it try again.
	•	7. Continuously Verify for Consistency and Coherence: As you generate pieces with the LLM, keep a notes document of the protocol’s facts and the storyline events. It’s easy to lose track if you’re creating non-linearly. If the AI introduces a new rule or contradicts something, you have two choices: incorporate it by adjusting your “bible” (maybe it’s a clever idea you like), or correct it in the next prompt. Don’t hesitate to say in the prompt: “Correction: Actually, in this world, AI are not allowed to vote, so rewrite the above where that doesn’t happen.” The model will usually comply and re-generate correctly. This kind of self-correcting prompting can be iterative. It’s akin to having an assistant whom you continually fact-check. Over time, the AI’s outputs will better align with the established protocol, especially if you frequently remind it of key details. Leveraging the AI’s capability to handle details, you can even ask it to summarize the current state of the story or list all established rules so far, which you then verify. This not only checks consistency but might reveal threads to pursue (“it listed 5 rules, but rule 6 we hinted at hasn’t been detailed – maybe a story opportunity”).

By employing these prompting strategies, writers can effectively harness LLMs to generate rich, system-oriented fiction without losing creative control. The idea is to create a feedback loop between you and the AI: you prompt with guidance, it offers ideas, you select/refine, and prompt again – much like an interactive development of a protocol itself. With practice, this collaborative process can significantly boost your productivity and perhaps even lead you down imaginative paths you wouldn’t have found alone. The end result is a story that is both coherent and surprising, built around a strong central protocol and brought to life through a human-AI partnership.

By synthesizing insights from Matt Webb’s essays on protocol fiction ? ?, Venkatesh Rao’s Protocolized dispatch on Chiang’s Law ?, César Aira’s perspective on procedural creativity ? ?, and practical experiences from Summer of Protocols workshops, this report has outlined what protocol fiction is and how one might write it with the help of AI. In protocol fiction, the rules of the imagined world take center stage, and writing with LLMs offers a new procedural toolset to explore those rules in depth. By applying structured strategies and iterative prompting, authors can craft stories that not only captivate readers with “strange new rules” ? but also potentially serve as blueprints for future realities. ? ?
